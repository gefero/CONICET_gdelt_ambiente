4th Thursday, November 2021 - 09:55 UTC Full article

For Argentina, the first 10 months of 2021 showed a 45.4% YoY increase in exports and a 46.3% yoy increase in imports. Hence the deficit.

Argentina's trade balance with Brazil yielded positive results for the second straight month in October 2021. However, numbers for the first 10 months of the year are still in the red.

After eight months of deficit, positive outcomes in two months were still insufficient for Argentina to surmount the trade deficit with the neighbour and Mercosur partner, which stands currently at US $ 510 million, according to data from Brazil's Special Secretariat for Foreign Trade and International Affairs (SECINT).

Nevertheless, Argentine exports have reached a record in seven years, after October's US $ 92 million surpluses. Exports to Brazil registered a year-on-year growth of 50.7% to total about US $ 1.218 million, the highest amount since September 2014, driven by sales of vehicles, wheat and corn.

On the other hand, imports climbed 37.6% annually, boosted by purchases of iron and steel.

Thus, the volume of trade between the two countries reached US $ 2,344 million, the highest in more than three years.

A report by the consulting firm Abeceb explained that Argentina's restrictions on car imports and Brazil's difficulties in exporting due to the lack of supply of semiconductor chips, led to these results, in addition to the crisis for hydroelectric generation in Brazil due to the drought, which favoured Argentine exports.

The accumulated commercial exchange so far in 2021 was 11.4% above that of the same period of 2019, which shows a recovery from pre-pandemic times.

For Argentina, the first 10 months of 2021 showed a 45.4% YoY increase in exports and a 46.3% YoY increase in imports. Hence the deficit.

”Historically, it has been seen that recoveries in trade are accompanied by a greater red in the foreign exchange balance for Argentina, given that the trade balance with Brazil has been in deficit since 2004 (except in 2019) due to the wide industrial asymmetries,” Abeceb's report explained.

“This fact is relevant considering that we expect the domestic economy to grow faster than the Brazilian in 2021 (+ 7.9% vs + 4.9% annually) and 2022 (+ 2% vs + 1.2%), it went on.

The consulting firm also foresees that in the short term trade will continue to increase hand in hand with the exit from the pandemic but some uncertainty still lingers for 2022.

Brazil is going through successive cuts in the economic expansion projections and the erosion in consumer and industrial confidence, in addition to a more contractionary monetary policy amid growing inflation, plus uncertainty stemming from the presidential elections.

Abeceb also highlighted Argentina's restrictions on currency exchange, which could affect trade as a devaluation of the peso is highly anticipated.

Additionally, normalization of the difficulties faced by global supply chains will take time to come, so it is expected that a certain shortage of key inputs (such as chips) will continue, preventing a smooth operation of manufacturing activity, and with it, Finally, although the outlook improved in September and October, the historical downspout of the Paraná River will continue to be a factor to monitor since the prospect of drought for the coming months suggests that it could continue to hinder the normal trade flow between the two countries,” the report added.

“There will have to be planning, an adaptation to this (COP26 agreement),” Mourao said

Following Glasgow's declaration whereby the world -Brazil's delegation included- has agreed to reduce the emission of methane gas by 30% by 2030, Brazilian livestock producers have realized they will need to adjust their work so that the country can fulfil such a commitment.

Vice President Hamilton Mourao addressed this issue saying his country will have a hard job dealing with the emission of methane gas, generated by manure.

”The issue of methane is linked to the excrement of livestock (activity), we have a huge cattle herd, there will have to be planning, and adaptation to this (COP26 agreement), Mourao said.

In 2020 Brazil had 218 million heads of cattle, according to a report published last month by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Between 2019 and 2020 the number of heads grew by 1.5%, boosted by growth in meat exports.



General Mourao is the head of the Amazon Council, a body made up of several ministries, which sets policy guidelines on the rainforest where cattle-producing farms have multiplied.

We have a deadline to adapt, a large part of the producers are already working to collect the manure and then burn it so that it does not pollute the atmosphere,” said the vice president.

The devastating loss of forests is one of the most exposed problems at COP26, which ended up placing the spotlight on Brazil's Amazon rainforest and the rainforest in Congo, after 124 leaders signed the 'Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use,' Brazil's delegation among them.

Meeting Glasgow's goals will require transformative actions, such as the ones Mourao addressed.",Brazilian livestock producers will have to deal with manure differently to meet Glasgow's goals

Leite es la máxima autoridad de Brasil en Glasgow después de que Bolsonaro decidiera no asistir

El ministro de Medio Ambiente de Brasil, Joaquim Leite, exigió a los asistentes a la Cumbre Climática COP26 de Glasgow que corresponde a los países más ricos del mundo proporcionar el financiamiento de las estrategias de desarrollo limpio de las naciones menos avanzadas económicamente.

Necesitamos más recursos que los US $ 100 mil millones; estos días llegó un estudio de un banco que habla de US $ 5 billones, dijo Leite en la capital escocesa.

Los países en desarrollo necesitan financiación para remodelar sus economías y adaptarse a los objetivos mundiales de reducir las emisiones de carbono y los gases de efecto invernadero.

”¿Cuál es el gran desafío en esta segunda semana (COP26)? Hablar de financiamiento e incentivos para llevar a cabo proyectos ambientalmente sustentables, explicó Leite.

El ministro estaba siguiendo los pasos del presidente brasileño Jair Bolsonaro, quien señaló por primera vez la necesidad de apoyo financiero a su colega estadounidense Joseph Biden en abril de este año.

El delegado brasileño insistió en que su país se había comprometido a eliminar por completo la deforestación ilegal de la Amazonía y otros biomas para el 2028 y reducir las emisiones de carbono en un 50% para el 2030.

Leite es el dignatario de más alto rango de Brasil en la Cumbre luego de la decisión de Bolsonaro de no asistir al evento global. Se dice que durante la presidencia de Bolsonaro, la deforestación de la Amazonia ha crecido drásticamente.

El papel de Brasil en la COP26 es buscar un consenso multilateral para que podamos avanzar hacia una economía más verde; el desafío no es detener el desarrollo económico en la Amazonía, dijo Leite este martes.

“Creo que el desafío global es una transición responsable hacia la neutralidad de carbono. Rápido, pero responsablemente”, señaló también Leite.

El ministro citó asimismo un estudio del grupo Boston Consulting según el cual el mundo necesitará US $ 150 mil millones durante los próximos 30 años si quiere cumplir los objetivos del Acuerdo de París.

El papel de Brasil [en la COP26] es tratar de encontrar un consenso multilateral para avanzar de manera justa hacia una economía más verde. El gran desafío es el financiamiento, el incentivo [financiero]. El desafío no es castigar, prohibir o detener [el desarrollo económico]. Se trata de acelerar hacia una nueva economía verde. ¿Y cómo lo hago? Incentivando. Con innovación”, dijo Leite.

“Brasil apoya claramente este movimiento de que la solución para una nueva economía, neutral en emisiones, radica en el incentivo, en el emprendimiento, en el interés verde, que hace que cualquier proyecto se mantenga. Y muchos proyectos, en algunas regiones, todavía no tienen la capacidad para hacer esta transición que todos esperan”, explicó el funcionario.","Los objetivos sostenibles requieren financiación, dice en Glasgow un ministro brasileño"

”Our country will shortly be able to become one of the world suppliers of this fuel that will allow to drastically reduce carbon emissions in the world,” President Fernández said

The Argentine Government has reached an understanding with a leading Australian firm to move forward with local production of clean energy. President Alberto Fernández made the announcement Monday from Glasgow, where he is attending the UN COP26 Climate Summit.

Fernández met in Scotland with businessmen from the Australian firm Fortescue, who pledged to invest over US $ 8 billion to produce green hydrogen.

During the meeting, Fernández was joined by Productive Development Minister Matías Kulfas, Foreign Minister Santiago Cafiero, Secretary for International Economic Relations Cecilia Todesco, and Kulfas' adviser Marcelo Kloster.

The company was represented by Andrew Forrest (President), Julie Shuttleworth (CEO), Agustín Pichot (President for Latin America), Todd Clewett (Senior Global Manager) and Sebastián Delgui (Regional Manager of Government and Communities for Latin America).

Fernández had already held a meeting via videoconference in Nov. 2020 with representatives of Fortescue Metals Group, who had expressed their interest in investing in Argentina in the generation of renewable energy and the production of minerals. within the framework of what they call green industry.

Fortescue has already begun prospecting in the province of Río Negro with a view to the production of green hydrogen at an industrial scale, which will require an investment of US $ 8.4 billion and will create over 15,000 direct jobs and between 40,000 and 50,000 indirect sources of income, it was reported.

The development is expected to turn Río Negro into a global green hydrogen export pole by 2030, with a production capacity of 2.2 million tons per year, tantamount to almost 10% of the electricity consumed by Germany in one year.

Fernández said, Argentina has a great opportunity ahead and it needs companies like this, that invest and generate work. The President also highlighted green hydrogen is one of the fuels of the future and it fills us with pride that Argentina is one of the countries that are at the forefront of the ecological transition.

Our country will shortly be able to become one of the world suppliers of this fuel that will allow to drastically reduce carbon emissions in the world,” Fernández went on.

The head of state also praised the social responsibility of the company to build with the best values of the communities, and particularly of former international rugbier Agustín Pichot.

We are ready to invest in Argentina, we are a cutting-edge energy company that hires people and we train people, and that is what we want to do in your country. We are here so that Argentina is a world leader in renewable energy and to be an exporter,” Fortescue's Forrest said.

The project will be developed around the city of Sierra Grande, which has a history of iron ore production. The first productive stage, with an estimated investment of US $ 7.2 billion, will produce some 215,000 tons of green hydrogen, which would cover the electricity consumption of 1.6 million homes, and will run until 2028.",Australian firm pledges US $ 8 bn to green hydrogen development in Argentina

To put global emissions within range of a 2 degrees target would cost 0.2 to 1.2 percent of GDP, with the biggest burden falling on richer countries





By Kristalina Georgieva, IMF Managing Director – In 1785, Robert Burns reflected on how humanity has come to dominate our planet: “I’m truly sorry man’s dominion, has broken nature’s social union,” he wrote. The Scottish poet’s words still ring true two centuries later.

Man-made climate change threatens our planet’s ecosystem and the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. From the IMF perspective, climate change presents a grave threat to macroeconomic and financial stability.

Now, the window of opportunity for containing global warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius is closing rapidly.

As world leaders gather in Glasgow for COP26, a new IMF Staff Climate shows unchanged global policies will leave 2030 carbon emissions far higher than needed to “keep 1.5 alive.” Cuts of 55% below baseline levels in 2030 would be urgently needed to meet that goal, and of 30% to meet the 2 degrees Celsius objective.

To achieve these cuts, policymakers attending COP26 must address two critical gaps: in ambition and in policy.

The global mitigation ambition gap

135 countries representing more than three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions have committed to net zero by mid-century. But we fall short in pledges for the near term. Even if current commitments for 2030 were met, this would only amount to between one and two-thirds of the reductions needed for temperature goals.

Advanced economies are expected to cut emissions more rapidly for reasons of equity and historical responsibility. They have collectively pledged to cut their emissions 43% below 2030 levels.

At the same time, higher-income emerging market economies have together pledged a 12% cut, and lower-income emerging market economies, 6%.

However, the Climate Note shows regardless of how cuts are spread across country groups, everyone has to do more.

For example, getting in the range of the 2 degrees target could be achieved with emissions cuts from advanced economies, high-income emerging markets, and low-income emerging markets of 45, 30, and 20 percent, respectively. A different balance of effort with cuts of 55, 25, and 15 percent would achieve the same goal, as would a weighting of 65, 20, and 10 percent.

To stay on track for 1.5 degrees, much more ambitious reductions are required for the same groups of countries. For example,70, 55, and 35 percent, or 80, 50, and 30 percent below 2030 baseline levels.

The good news is abatement costs are manageable. To put global emissions within range of a 2 degrees target would cost 0.2 to 1.2 percent of GDP, with the biggest burden falling on richer countries. And in many nations, the cost of shifting away from fossil fuels may be offset by domestic environmental benefits, most notably reductions in deaths from local air pollution.¬¬

Enhanced external financing will be essential to support stronger mitigation ambition for emerging markets and developing economies. Advanced economies must fulfill their commitment to provide US$ 100 billion per year in finance to low-income countries from 2020 onward. The most recent figures show that we remain short of that target.

In addition, to scale up private financing, certainty over public mitigation objectives will be critical, especially price signals to level the playing field for clean technologies. Also critical will be better-quality and standardized information, so investors can help address perceived risks, including in low-income countries.

The global mitigation policy gap

Even with sufficiently ambitious pledges, we still need policies to implement the emissions cuts.

Carbon pricing—charges on the carbon content of fuels or their emissions—should play a central role, especially for large emitters. At a stroke, it provides a price signal to redirect private investment to low carbon technologies and energy efficiency.

But the gap between what’s required versus what’s in place is very large. A global carbon price exceeding US$ 75 per ton would be needed by 2030, to keep warming below 2 degrees.

At the international level, coordination will be critical to overcome political economy constraints and scale up carbon pricing. Think of concerns about competitiveness and uncertainty over policy actions that make it difficult for countries to act alone.

Addressing these issues is at the heart of an IMF staff protocol for an international carbon price floor among a small group of large emitters.

Such a floor would be equitable, with differentiated pricing for countries at different levels of economic development, alongside financial and technological assistance for low-income participants. And the price floor arrangement would be pragmatic, allowing for national implementation through non-pricing measures that achieve equivalent outcomes.

It would be collaborative, helping avoid contentious border carbon adjustments if some countries move ahead with robust pricing while others do not.

At the domestic level, carbon pricing reforms could jump-start emissions reductions. Critically, this need not come at the cost of the economy. Recent empirical studies suggest that carbon pricing reforms have not reduced GDP or employment. Indeed, such reforms could support long-run growth objectives. Revenues from carbon pricing—typically around 1 percent of GDP or more—can be used to reduce labor taxes or increase public investments, helping boost the economy.

These are just some examples of how mitigation strategies can—and must—bring wider benefits at all levels of society. Policymakers should ensure a just transition with robust assistance for vulnerable households, workers, and regions.

For instance, carbon pricing reforms can be equity-enhancing and pro-poor. If revenues are used to strengthen social safety nets and raise personal income tax thresholds, the policy has net benefits to poorest groups and neutral impacts on the middle class. Alternatively, revenues could be used for public investments in health or education.

Another key ingredient of any mitigation strategy is green public investment. We need to accelerate the adoption of clean technology infrastructure like smart grids and charging stations for electric vehicles. Working together, not only do private and public investments in clean energy have especially powerful growth effects, low-carbon industries also tend to be more labor-intensive than fossil fuels which can help boost employment.

Lastly, all reforms should also be introduced progressively and well-communicated, so firms and households can adjust. They should also cover broader emissions sources, such as methane, and enhance forest carbon storage.

The urgency of action

Without an urgent narrowing of ambition, policy, and financing gaps, a dangerous cliff-edge for emissions reductions beyond 2030 will be set up—greatly increasing transition costs, and potentially putting temperature goals permanently beyond reach.

An orderly, cooperative, and timely transition can and must happen. Now.

Thunberg had met with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who reportedly endorsed her struggle.

Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg said in the streets of Glasgow that “Leadership is out here, not inside COP26.”

Thunberg made those remarks while participating in a demonstration of environmentalist groups next to the convention centre where the climate summit is taking place. Change will not come from there because leadership is out here, not inside COP26, she stressed.

“We say no more 'blah blah blah,' no more exploitation of people, nature and the planet; no more whatever they do in there, Thunberg told reporters at Festival Park, on the banks of the River Clyde, which runs alongside COP26.

Thunberg arrived in Glasgow Sunday by train and plans to take part in two large protests by the end of the week, one on Nov. 5 organized by Fridays for Future and another on Nov. 6 scheduled by various British environmental organizations.

Within the COP there are only politicians and people in power who pretend to take our future seriously, who pretend to take seriously the presence of the people who are already being affected today by the climate crisis. The change will not come from there. That's not leadership. This is leadership, Thunberg insisted while pointing at the protesters.

Earlier Monday, Thunberg had met with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who reportedly endorsed her struggle.

More than a million people signed an open letter from Thunberg in which she demands that leaders face the climate emergency. It sets out requirements that governments must meet to address climate change, including maintaining the goal of preventing the global temperature from rising more than 1.5 ° C this century from pre-industrial levels.

Activist groups plan noisy demonstrations during COP26, especially in the coming days.

One of the most organized, Extinction Rebellion, appeared to hint at its willingness to provoke riots and arrests as a way to garner the attention of world leaders. The Glasgow Times said police would not rule out hundreds of arrests a day. Although the environmental group did not advance how or where it will protest, it confirmed that it will use non-violent direct action. The British Government has deployed more than 10,000 specially trained officers equipped with high-tech devices.

Meanwhile, Greenpeace has been authorized by Scottish authorities to navigate with its Rainbow Warrior boat on the River Clyde, which passes through Glasgow. The organization has insisted on its determination to reach the city with the ship, even though the authorities prohibited it from entering the port.

The Latinas for Climate was also present at Thunberg's speech to protest against the extractivist model that finances technology to confront climate change, but that goes beyond the rights of women, according to Chilean activist Karin Watson.

This model steals, smears and pollutes the lands of indigenous peoples,” Watson added about the extraction of lithium, a strategic metal that is essential for the manufacture of batteries that power zero-emission electric vehicles.

Colombian leaders are all out to develop businesses relations worldwide

Colombian President Iván Duque Monday said his country and Israel were “sister nations” that share principles of defence of democracy and private initiative.

Duque's words came in Jersusalem during a meeting with his Israeli counterpart Isaac Herzog, during which the South American leader confirmed a trade mission (INNpulsa – the Colombian government agency for entrepreneurship and innovation) office was to be open in Jerusalem, in addition to the possibility of having a permanent ProColombia (the agency promoting tourism. exports and investment) delegation at the main trading centres of Israel.

“Colombia and Israel have had diplomatic relations since 1949 and, over the years, they have been strengthening in cooperation, investment and trade. But I dare to say the following: we are today at the highest point in the bilateral relationship, expressed in the fact that during my government the free trade agreement (FTA) between Colombia and Israel has been signed, ratified and put into operation.”

Duque also pointed out that there were already 79 Colombian companies interacting with Israel and we can, perfectly, triple that number of companies, soon.

“Colombia and Israel share intelligence information, strategic information and fight against international terrorism. We have struck very important blows thanks to that cooperation,” Duque went on.

“What we have built over the years is not just a business relationship, an investment relationship. We share principles such as the defence of democracy, security as a democratic value and as a public good. And, above all, private initiative is the engine of development. So, President Herzog, thank you for receiving us, for your hospitality and we reiterate that we are waiting for you in our country.” Duque added.

Duque also stressed that INNpulsa's presence in Israel was aimed at turning Colombia into the Silicon Valley of Latin America. He also expressed his interest in working hand in hand with all Israeli technological innovation and entrepreneurship centres. “We are clear, Mr President, that with this relationship there will be many more Colombian companies that will interact with this country. Today we already have 79 and we can, perfectly, triple that number of companies soon.

The Colombian leader also addressed climate change, biodiversity, sustainability and adaptation, on which he aspires that we can also work hand in hand, and stressed: Colombia today leads the energy transition in Latin America, Colombia is moving forward in non-conventional renewable energies,” particularly regarding green hydrogen.

“We have decided that 30% of our territory be declared a protected area by the year 2022. And that, as you and I spoke about it, opens up a huge opportunity so that, through credits of carbon, countries like Israel can also help Colombia participate in financing schemes and, at the same time, within the schemes of carbon markets move towards carbon neutrality.”

The Colombian president added: “With all this, Mr President, I believe that our relations are advancing and we want them to be stronger. And, from now on, I reiterate what I told you in private, and I tell you in public, we want you to visit Colombia, we want you to be able to see on the ground all these areas that we have worked on,” Duque insisted.

Meanwhile, Colombian Vice President and Foreign Minister Marta Lucía Ramírez met Monday in Tokyo with Japan's Cabinet Chief Hirokazu Matsuno. We want Japanese companies to see Colombia as the best platform to develop their products and reach all markets in the region, Ramírez said, according to a Colombian Foreign Ministry statement.

Ramírez is on tour in search of cooperation and financing for projects in the field of non-conventional renewable energy and infrastructure.

Both officials also spoke about the joint vision of sustainable economic development that Colombia and Japan share, which, according to Ramírez, opens a window of opportunity for the exploration of new projects and cooperation agreements in areas such as non-conventional renewable energy and infrastructure.

The Vice President also met with Nobumitsu Hayashi, deputy governor of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), to whom she expressed the need for support for Colombia to spread unconventional renewable energies by multiplying by 50 the installed capacity by 2022.

In this sense, the JBIC offered to be a bridge to attract more Japanese investment to the country in projects of this type and infrastructure, said the Foreign Ministry.

Ramírez also met with Masato Miyachi, vice president of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), with Makoto Takashima, president of the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) and with Shinichi Kitaoka, president of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), with whom she discussed renewable energy and investment opportunities in infrastructure and energy in Colombia.",Colombian President says his country and Israel are sister nations

The international price of meat is exceptionally high “mainly due to the greater dynamism of the Chinese market and the cessation of exports by Argentina,” the report said

Beef, meat by-products and wood have boosted Uruguayan exports, which were reported to have grown 17.2% overall in October, it was announced Monday in Montevideo. Meat sales once again reached record figures.

Export applications —including duty-free zones— totalled US $ 897 million in October, which represented an increase of 17.2% compared to the same month in 2020, the Uruguay XXI Institute reported Monday.

Meanwhile, exports from customs -that is outside duty-free zones- reached US $ 782 million last month, a 16.6% growth compared to October last year.

Between January and October 2021, exports grew 31% YoY and 12% above pre-pandemic figures from January to October 2019, according to Uruguay XXI.

In October 2021, beef set a historical record, being once again the main exported item and the one with the greatest impact on the evolution of total exports. Sales worth US $ 259 million meant a 75% YoY increase.

The favourable evolution that occurred in October is explained by higher sales of beef, cellulose, meat by-products and wood. On the other hand, the products with the greatest negative impact on the variation of the month were soybeans, electricity, rice and pharmaceutical products, the report said.

Also in October, there was a significant increase in the movement of containers in the port of Montevideo, according to the National Port Administration posting on Twitter, with 54,748 containers moved, against 37,055 last year, which represents a growth of 47.74%.

Between October 2020 and October 2021, sales grew 23.7% or 31.3% if exports from duty-free zones are taken into account. This rise is explained by the increase in exports to China and the United States.

China remains Uruguay's main trading partner after an increase of 77.29% due to higher placements of meat, wood, dairy products and fish, among other items.

Uruguay XXI highlighted that ”the international price of meat is at exceptionally high values due to the strong recovery in world demand, mainly due to the greater dynamism of the Chinese market and the cessation of exports by Argentina, one of the largest meat producers in the world. Specifically, during October the export price was 28.3% higher than the same month in 2020.”

The main buyer of this product was China, which accounted for 71% of sales (US $ 184 million), which meant a variation of 95% compared to the same month of 2020. The beef was also sold to the European Union (10%), the United States (7%), Brazil (3%) and Japan (2%).

Cellulose sales abroad also rose 30% compared to October 2020. This increase “is exclusively due” to an improvement in the average export price, “which in the last quarter was close to” US $ 650, 63% above its average value in 2020.

Beverage concentrate exports totalled US $ 53 million. Mexico was the main destination with US $ 13 million (29% more than in October 2020), followed by Guatemala (US $ 8 million, 13% above Oct. 2020).

“In the accumulated of the year, sales reached 509 million dollars, 24% higher in year-on-year terms. The positive evolution for the year as a whole responds to an increase in export volumes (17%), which is accompanied by a 7% higher price compared to 2020 ”, the reports indicate.

As for meat by-products, exports doubled compared to October 2020, totalling US $50 million. ”The main destinations were China (51%), the United States (16%), Hong Kong (8%), the European Union (8%) and Russia (7%).”

On the other hand, dairy product sales decreased 6% compared to the same month in 2020; however, the marked growth between January and October is maintained, which was 12%. Brazil was the destination that fell the most (US $21 million in October 2020 to eight million in October 2021, which means a 60% drop), Algeria (-30%) and Cuba (-88%).

“However, the increase (265%) in sales to China stands out, reaching 13 million dollars, and offsets part of the decline in the main markets. The lower sales of powdered milk (-13%) could not be offset by the increase in butter exports (78%), being the only product with a positive impact in the month,” the report says.

Exports to Uruguay's main trading partner grew 77% in October 2021, compared to the same month in 2020, with an amount of US $ 230 million. The main exports were beef, meat by-products, wood, dairy products, fish and seafood.","Uruguayan exports on the rise, report shows"

A tribute by a government that ignores science and boycotts the recommendations of specialists is “not compatible with our careers,” the researchers wrote

A group of Brazilian scientists who were awarded the National Order of Scientific Merit have decided to turn down the honours after President Jair Bolsonaro chose to remove one of them from the list.

The decision came in solidarity after Bolsonaro refused to give the award to a researcher who had conducted a study on the ineffectiveness of chloroquine against the coronavirus. Chloroquine is a drug against malaria which Bolsonaro has defended throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a public letter released this weekend, 21 researchers from different universities and scientific centres have renounced the National Order of Scientific Merit, after the head of state excluded Marcus Vinícius Guimaraes Lacerda of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation medical research centre (Fiocruz) and Adele Schwartz Benzaken, director of Fiocruz for the Amazon.

A study by Lacerda shows how the use of chloroquine, a drug against malaria and lupus, is not only completely useless in patients with coronavirus, but if administered in higher doses it can also cause arrhythmias to people with heart conditions.

Benzaken, for her part, served as director of the department in charge of analyzing and investigating the AIDS disease and viral hepatitis of the Ministry of Health before being fired with the arrival of Bolsonaro to power.

Both had been included in the list of those who would receive the award this year by the Ministry of Science and Technology.

As scientists, we do not tolerate how denialism in general, peer harassment and recent cuts in federal budgets for science and technology have been used as tools to roll back the important advances made by the Brazilian scientific community in the last decades, the researchers said in a letter published by Folha de Sao Paulo.

Bolsonaro, who since the beginning of COVID-19 has minimized its effects and even recommended chloroquine as a medication, removed the two scientists from the list included in the decree published Saturday in an extraordinary issue of the Official Gazette.

The scientists resigning their medals addressed their letter to the Ministry of Science and Technology: We consider our presence on the list gratifying and we are very honoured with the possibility of receiving one of the highest recognitions that a scientist can receive in the country, but the tribute offered by a government that not only ignores science and actively boycotts the recommendations of specialists are not compatible with our careers.

According to an investigation by Congress, the Government's omissions in the face of the pandemic contributed to making Brazil the second country with the most deaths in the world, with more than 600,000 victims, and the third with more cases with 21.8 million infections.

The parliamentary committee that investigated the situation accused the president of nine crimes, including crimes against humanity, violation of sanitary measures and irregular use of public money.",Brazilian scientists turn down medals in repudiation of President Bolsonaro

Biden isisted western leaders needed to focus “on what China’s not doing, what Russia is not doing and what Saudi Arabia is not doing.”

As the Glasgow COP26 climate Summit was starting, US President Joseph Biden said from Rome that the United States and the European Union had agreed to negotiate the world's first trade agreement based on how much carbon is in a product.

Biden insisted tackling the climate crisis had been an all hands on deck effort as he unveiled new steps to strengthen global supply chains.

We're going to COP to deal with renewable energy, Biden announced. He also said he believed his Build Back Better plan and the $1 trillion infrastructure bill will be voted on sometime this week, God willing. And it's going to pass, in my view, he added. The bill includes nearly US $ 2 trillion in taxes and spending to help rebuild the economy after the COVID-19 crisis.

Biden also stressed people were disappointed that Russia and China leaders didn’t “show up” at the G20 Summit, but the leaders who did attend made “significant progress” regarding climate change. “I think you are going to see we have made significant progress and more has to be done,” he said.

“It’s going to require us to continue to focus on what China’s not doing, what Russia is not doing and what Saudi Arabia is not doing,” he went on.

Meanwhile, US climate envoy John Kerry outlined what was to be expected at Glasgow, such as raising “global ambition very significantly,” which entails countries committing to what he called a “decade of action” to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

“We also know that there’s real loss and damage out there, that there are nation-states that are talking about where their people are going to move because the sea level is rising. There are areas where people can no longer live. And migrants are moving around the planet as a consequence of the destruction of habitat,” Kerry said.

“I don’t think you can galvanize the kind of global action that you need to be able to accomplish our goals if we're not being sensitive and thoughtful about people up and down the economic food chain and people who have done nothing, in most cases, to contribute to the problem.”

The climate summit follows a meeting of G-20 leaders in Rome where they agreed to work to reach carbon neutrality “by around mid-century” and pledged to end financing for coal plants abroad by the end of this year, but failed to agree on phasing out coal domestically. The grouping of 19 countries and the European Union accounts for more than three-quarters of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. In October, two dozen countries joined a U.S.- and EU-led effort to slash methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Coal, though, is a bigger point of contention. G-20 members China and India have resisted attempts to produce a declaration on phasing out domestic coal consumption.

Climate financing, namely pledges from wealthy nations to provide US $ 100 billion a year to support developing countries efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change, is another key concern. Indonesia, a large greenhouse gas emitter that will take over the G-20 presidency in December, urged developed countries to fulfil their financing commitments both in Rome and in Glasgow.",Biden announces US-UE negotiating carbon-conscious trade agreement

Chain of fast-flowing Antarctic glaciers named for important climate meetings including Glasgow, Geneva, Paris and Berlin

While the world gathers in Glasgow over the next fortnight to make progress on tackling climate change, 10,000 miles away the city’s namesake will provide a stark reminder of why urgent action is needed.

An enormous body of ice in Antarctica has been formally named the ‘Glasgow Glacier’ by researchers at the University of Leeds to mark the COP26 Summit.

PhD researcher Heather Selley identified 14 glaciers in the Getz basin of West Antarctica that sped up by an average of 25% between 1994 and 2018 due to climate change. Her study, published in February, found that 315 gigatons of ice has been lost from the region over the last 25 years, adding the equivalent of 126 million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water to the world’s oceans.

Scientists Heather Selley and Dr Anna Hogg requested that the nine unnamed glaciers in her study be named for the locations of major climate treaties, reports and conferences, the most recent of which is Glasgow. Her proposal was submitted by the UK Government and supported by the UK Antarctic Place-names committee. The names will now be added to the international Composite Gazetteer for Antarctica, for use on maps, charts and future publications.

At the G20 the Prime Minister will tell world leaders that time is running out to save civilization from catastrophic climate change.

As the foremost gathering of the world’s largest economies – who between them account for 75% of global emissions – the G20 has a unique ability and responsibility to prevent climate change. There has been progress in recent weeks, but barely half of G20 countries have set out more ambitious plans for cutting carbon emissions since 2015 and there are still two G20 members who have not committed to net zero.

By naming this glittering giant of nature after the city where humankind will gather to fight for the future of the planet, we have a stark reminder of what we are working to preserve.

Glasgow represents our best chance. Just as the G20 shares a collective responsibility to act, so the solutions are in our hands. I hope countries will gather this week in a spirit of responsibility and ambition so we can keep the goal of 1.5 degrees alive”.

The Prime Minister is expected to tell about UK’s experience which shows how countries can continue to grow while cutting carbon emissions. He will point out that fifty years ago the UK derived around 80% of UK electricity from burning coal, nine years ago that number was nearly 40% and today it is below 2%. The UK will phase out the use of coal in power generation completely by 2024.

The UK is calling on the world’s richest economies to do everything they can to reach Net Zero carbon emissions domestically by 2050, while helping developing countries transition to clean energy, and halting and reversing deforestation and land degradation by 2030.

Dramatic changes in ice cover and images of Antarctica have become synonymous with climate change. Over the past 40 years, satellites have observed huge iceberg calving events, changes in the flow of glaciers and rapidly thinning ice demonstrating the devastating impact of global warming.","Antarctica and the Glasgow Glacier, a symbol of why COP26 must deliver"

Prince Charles of Wales has been a committed environmental campaigner for over 50 years

Prince Charles of Wales has warned world leaders gathered at the G20 summit in Rome that they were having an “overwhelming responsibility to generations yet unborn” regarding climate issues, ahead of the COP 26 summit in Glasgow.

The heir to the British throne, who was invited to speak by Italy's prime minister, Mario Draghi, said “This is the last chance saloon” to save the planet. “Quite literally” so!

The Prince also told G20 leaders in Rome that “I am, at last, sensing a change in attitudes and the build-up of positive momentum.”

“It is impossible not to hear the despairing voices of young people who see you as the stewards of the planet, holding the viability of their future in your hands,” he added.

“We must now translate fine words into still finer actions and as the enormity of the climate challenge dominates people's conversations from newsrooms to living rooms. And as the future of humanity and nature herself are at stake it is surely time to set aside our differences and grasp this unique opportunity to launch a substantial green recovery by putting the global economy on a confident sustainable trajectory and thus save our planet,” he went on.

Charles also told politicians that the private sector was “eager” to work with them and “ready to play a hugely significant and game-changing role.”

From that perspective, the Crown Prince insisted solutions to major issues “seem possible only if there is a much closer partnership between Government, the main multilateral banks, the private sector and its investors.”

Charles is due to welcome leaders to COP26 in Glasgow. The Queen was due to attend but has been advised to rest by her doctors.

The speech came after Charles joined Prime Minister Boris Johnson, US President Joseph Biden and other world leaders at a gala dinner Saturday evening marking the end of a G20 summit.

The reception comes amid high tensions between Mr Johnson and Mr Macron as Britain and France continue to clash over post-Brexit fishing licences. The dispute also has ramifications into what is known as the AUSKUS case, a deal through which Australia was to purchase conventional submarines from France but was left undone due to diplomatic meddling.

Prince Charles was also to deliver one of the key speeches at the opening ceremony of the climate summit in Glasgow. Helping to welcome the world leaders, the prince will stress the urgency of dealing with the climate crisis, saying: We have to put ourselves on what might be called a war-like footing.

He will urge world leaders to more actively engage with the business community to unlock the trillions of dollars that could help find solutions, saying: We need a vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private sector. With trillions at its disposal.

The war-footing analogy is one the prince has used before as a call to action. Last year, during a video message for Climate Week NYC, he called for a Marshall-like plan for nature, people and the planet.

The Queen, in recent weeks, has expressed her frustrations, saying in the run-up to COP26 that she was irritated at leaders who talk but don't do.

Prince Charles has been a committed environmental campaigner for over 50 years.

It is only too clear that we will need trillions of dollars of investment every year to create the necessary new infrastructure and meet the vital 1.5-degree climate target that will save our forests and farms, our oceans and our wildlife,” he also said while in Rome.

No government has those sorts of sums - which is why I have spent so much time over the past 19 months trying to form a global alliance amongst the private sector, as I have long believed it holds the ultimate key to the solutions we seek.”

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is serving as host of the conference in Glasgow, Scotland, is expected to stress the urgency of acting, saying humanity has waited for too long. “If we don’t get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow,” Johnson will say, according to excerpts released by his office.",Prince Charles warns G20 leaders of their duties regarding climate issues

The worst is yet to come “if we fail to seize this moment,” according to the US President

US President Joseph Biden Monday said the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow should mark the starting point of a decade of ambition and innovation to fight climate change, which he believed is an existential threat. The summit is often billed as essential to putting the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord into action.

This is the decade that will determine the next generations. It is the decisive decade in which we have the opportunity to show ourselves that we can maintain the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, Biden warned. He also insisted climate change was not something hypothetical, but rather something which already affects people in the form of uncontrolled fires, floods or droughts.

None of us can escape the worst of what is to come if we fail to seize this moment, he stressed. He also announced new climate initiatives, including billions of dollars in hoped-for legislation to help poorer communities abroad deal with the consequences of this global scourge. “In an age where this pandemic has made so painfully clear that no nation can wall itself off from borderless threats, we know that none of us can escape the worst that’s yet to come, if we fail to seize this moment,” Biden underlined.

Biden also lauded a separate US-European Union steel agreement announced Sunday as a chance to curb imports of “dirty” Chinese steel forged by coal power. It’s another step toward potentially using Western markets as leverage to persuade China, the world’s top climate polluter, to ease up in its enthusiasm for coal power.

Rather than a quick fix, “Glasgow is the beginning of this decade race, if you will,” Biden’s climate envoy, John Kerry, had told reporters Sunday. Kerry also defended the outcome of the G20 meeting in Rome, where leaders agreed on a series of measures, including formalizing a pledge to cut off international subsidies for dirty-burning, coal-fired power plants. But G-20 leaders offered more vague pledges than commitments of firm action, saying they would seek carbon neutrality “by or around mid-century.”

Since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015 with the goal of reducing its carbon footprint, the US has actually increased carbon emissions, but steps have been taken in thye opposite direction, while major polluters like China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have no immediate intention of following suit.

Biden told reporters Sunday night he personally found the outcome of the Rome summit “disappointing,” because “not only Russia but China basically didn’t show up in terms of any commitments to deal with climate changes.”

The Biden administration Monday released its strategy for turning talk into reality in transforming the country into an entirely clean energy nation by 2050. The long-term plan, filed in compliance with the Paris agreement, lays out a United States increasingly running on wind, solar and other clean energy, Americans zipping around in electric vehicles and on mass transit, state-of-the-art technology and wide open spaces carefully preserved to soak up carbon dioxide from the air.

The Biden administration has succeeded, over 10 months of diplomacy leading up to the Glasgow summit, in helping win significant new climate pledges from allies. That includes persuading many foreign governments to set more ambitious targets for emissions cuts, promoting a global pledge to cut emissions of a potent climate harm, methane, and the promise from leading economies to end funding for coal energy abroad.

European leaders make clear they are happy to see Biden and the U.S. back in the climate effort after his predecessor, Donald Trump, turned his back on the Paris accord and on allies in general. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen smiled at Biden throughout the announcement on Sunday’s steel deal, calling him “dear Joe.”",Biden tells Glasgow attendees the 2020s will determine the next generations regarding climate change

A train turned into complete loss after radical groups' attacks, which then set them on fire

Chilean president Sebastian Piñera announced on Tuesday he sent Congress a bill requesting a further fifteen days extension of the state of emergency in four areas of the Biobío and Araucaria regions, where there have been violent breaches of law and order.

Under the exceptional emergency state umbrella, the Armed Forces have been called in support of the local police and Carabineros, who have faced shootouts and repeated incidents of arson against homes, forests camps and trucks loaded with logs, from radical groups belonging to the indigenous Mapuche people.

However, the Armed Forces will not replace the Carabineros in their law and order duties but will give logistics, technological, communications, transport, and video web support to police on the beat, pointed out Piñera in his message.

In the first twenty days of the current emergency, we have managed to lower the number of acts of violence in the two regions and have netted individuals with pending arrest orders, continued the Chilean president. But we must not lower our guard or fall into a false confidence since we must admit that violence is still present in those territories.

And although we are acting under a situation contemplated in the Constitution, we have not suspended or restricted any rights or constitutional guarantees of members of the communities and we have fully respected human rights

Therefore we urge congress to approve the extension of the emergency state, as well as other measures to contain violence. Since 2019 Chile is under the influence of the so-called social uprising, which almost toppled the elected government of Piñera, now seriously weakened.

To this must be added the ongoing outbursts of violence from radical groups among the indigenous Mapuches, who are also causing havoc on the other side of the Andes in Argentine Patagonia.

Industries linked to construction had an increase of 19,5%; manufacturing, 10,4%, while mining contracted 6,7%

Chile's September Monthly Economic Activity Index, (IMACEC), jumped 15,6% compared to a year ago, above market expectations (13%), and 1,7% over the previous month, as reported by the Chilean central bank.

All IMACEC components have grown, particularly services, and to a lesser extent the production of goods and retail trade, according to the central bank, and this is the result mainly of a greater opening of the economy, support measures for households, the partial withdrawal of pension funds, and because of the much lower base which was September 2020

As to the performance of different sectors, goods production was up 7,5%, particularly in association with industries linked to construction that reached 19,5%; manufacturing, 10,4%, while mining contracted 6,7%

Relative to commerce, activity ballooned 20,3% including sales of machinery and equipment and at the retail level, sales of clothing, footwear and household equipment. Meantime services increased 19%, focused on personal services, mainly education and health. To a lesser extent restaurants, hotels and transport. Overall it was a 3,6% increase over the previous month.

The central bank also revealed its inflation estimate for the whole twelve months of 5,4% and thus the Monetary Policy Rate is expected to reach 5% in March 2022, according to the latest survey of financial operators.

Likewise October inflation is estimated at 1%, November, 0,6% and December 0,5%. The central bank lending rate is anticipated to end at 3,5%. By 2022 the central bank lending rate will steadily increase, 5% in March, 5,25% in May and 5,5% in June. Finally, the survey estimates that the US dollar will float in the range of 825 Chilean Pesos during November.","Chile's economy activity index in September increased 15,6% year to year"

The National Geographic Endurance calling Ushuaia begins this week the official Argentine cruise season

Argentine Minister of Tourism Matias Lammens and Tierra del Fuego governor Gustavo Melella officially opened the 2021/22 cruise season this Monday, in Ushuaia, with the arrival of “National Geographic Endurance”, which tomorrow leaves for Antarctica.

It was very difficult to think in a cruise season, but we made the political decision since we know what it means for the local and national economy. Tourism is the locomotive of the province's recovery, pointed out Lammens. He added we've worked hard to sustain the sector, but now is the moment to grow with the support of an innovative State.

Governor Melella expressed his satisfaction and said it was a great moment to begin the recovery, thanking the federal government and the private sector for their joint efforts in sustaining jobs.

The officials then met with Captain Oliver Kruess, who invited them to a tour of the National Geographic Endurance, docked in the port of Ushuaia since its arrival on Sunday.

The head of Tierra del Fuego provincial ports Roberto Murcia met on Sunday with Captain Kruess and said it was a motive of pride that the 2021 cruise season was taking off from Ushuaia and travelling to our Antarctica. The fact that an expedition vessel has chosen Ushuaia, confirms that we are the gateway to Antarctica.

Further Murcia said Tierra del Fuego was grateful to the federal ministries and local health authorities in helping draft and approve the Covid 19 protocols and establishing a safe corridor from the international Malvinas Argentinas airport to the dock for passengers to embark.

The provincial official said they were looking forward to a very encouraging tourism season since some 243 cruise calls are scheduled involving 37 vessels. Our strict sanitary measures and the successful vaccination program in the province are the great support for the season

Captain Kruess said he was extremely pleased to be back in Ushuaia. When we left Ushuaia in March 2020 we thought we would need to be very lucky to see the following season...It was a terrible year, our vessels idle without operating, we did the presentation of this new vessel and her sister but were never able to operate. That is why we are so happy today and full of expectations”.

The National Geographic Endurance is an expedition vessel for 126 tourists, and has a very revolutionary hull with an X-Bow, which allows for a more gentle and ecologic sailing, more fuel efficient and less carbon contaminating. On Friday November 19, she is expected to meet in Ushuaia with her sister, National Geographic Resolution.

The vessels work for Lindblad Expeditions, and will have three National Geographic vessels based in Ushuaia, Endurance, Resolution and Explorer.

Among the cruises offered by Lindblad Expeditions include the 14-day Journey to Antarctica: The White Continent; 24-day Antarctica, South Georgia & the Falklands; 19-day South Georgia & the Falklands; 20-day Patagonia & Antarctica: Legendary Ice and Epic Fjords (this voyage embarks in Punta Arenas); and 33-day Epic Antarctica: South Sandwich Islands, South Georgia & The Peninsula.",Antarctica cruise season 2021/22 launched in Ushuaia with National Geographic vessels

Leite is Brazil's highest-ranking authority at Glasgow after Bolsonaro chose not to attend

Brazil's Environment Minister Joaquim Leite Wednesday demanded attendees at Glasgow's COP26 Summit that it was up to the wealthiest countries in the world to provide for the financing of the developing nations' clean development strategies.

We need more resources than the US $ 100 billion; these days a study came from a bank talking about US $ 5 trillion, Leite said at the Scottish capital.

Developing countries are in need of funding to reshape their economies and adapt to the world's goals reducing carbon emissions and greenhouse gases.

”What is the great challenge in this second week (COP26)? Talk about financing and incentives to carry out environmentally sustainable projects, Leite explained.

The minister was just following on the steps of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who first broke the need of financial support to his US colleague Joseph Biden back in April this year.

The Brazilian delegate insisted his country had pledged to completely eliminate illegal deforestation of the Amazon and other biomes by 2028 and to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030.

Leite is Brazil's highest ranking dignatary at the Summit following Bolsonaro's decision not to attend the global event. It is said that under Bolsonaro, deforestation of Amazonia has grown sharply.

Brazil's role at COP26 is to seek a multilateral consensus so that we can move towards a greener economy; the challenge is not to stop economic development in the Amazon, Leite said Tuesday.

“I think the global challenge is a responsible transition to carbon neutrality. Quickly, but responsibly,” Leite also pointed out.

The minister also cited a study by the Boston Consulting group according to which the world will need US $ 150 billion over the next 30 years if it wants to meet the Paris Agreement goals.

Brazil's role [at COP26] is to try to find a multilateral consensus so that we move fairly towards a greener economy. The great challenge is financing, the [financial] incentive. The challenge is not to punish, prohibit or stop [economic development]. It's about accelerating towards a new green economy. And how do I do it? By incentivizing. With innovation,” he said.

“Brazil clearly supports this movement that the solution for a new economy, neutral in emissions, lies in the incentive, in entrepreneurship, in the green interest, that makes any project be maintained. And many projects, in some regions, still do not have the capacity to make this transition that everyone expects,” Leite elaborated.","Sustainable goals require funding, Brazilian minister tells Glasgow"

International travel is to be allowed exclusively through Santiago's Arturo Merino Benítez international airport.

As announced last week, Chile is opening its borders as of July 26 to nationals and foreign residents stranded abroad since March on the condition that they are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus.

However, local health officials have been voicing their concerns regarding what the new measures may entials in terms of new variants of the Sars-CoV-2 landing in the country after months of harsh sanitary measures.

Experts have insisted on the importance of tracing the whereabouts of the incoming travelers as well as other steps which the reopening of the borders may involve, such as the mobility pass.

Entrance into the country is to be allowed only through Santiago's Arturo Merino Benítez international airport.

Álvaro Erazo, a former health minister under President Michelle Bachelet -a medical doctor herself- warned that border control is essential to combat the new variants.

Those entering the country must sign an affidavit 48 hours before boarding their planes. Te document, together with a negative PCR test from 72 hours at most, prior to taking their flights, are to be required by airlines and health authorities alike.

Infectologist Guillermo Acuña has pointed out that waiting at the crowded airports can be a problem, while lung-diseases specialist Carolina Herrera made it clear that beyond individual responsibility, the pandemic has not ended.

Claudia Saavedra, a medical doctor and spokesperson for Chile's Society of Microbiology, insisted on tracing those who enter the country.

Meanwhile, residents of Santiago have enjoyed their first restriction-free weekend since March thanks to the significant reduction in infections, which led authorities to ease the limitations on activities and circulation, with bars, movie theaters and other recreational facilities reopening their doors since Saturday, not only in the Chilean capital but also in 51 other communes in the Metropolitan Region.

Three months after the serious second wave of infections that affected the country, Chile has recovered and currently has the lowest coronavirus positivity rate.

Nevertheless, Chile is studying the possibility of applying a third dose of coronavirus vaccine. Over 85% of the target population has already received at least one dose, while 78% have completed their two-shot schedule, which has resulted in a reduction in the number of patients admitted into intensive care units.

In addition to allowing the return of travelers, the Chilean Government will also authorize the departure of those who wish to leave, but they will have to observe a mandatory 10-day isolation at their homes upon returning.",Experts voice concern as Chile prepares to reopen its borders following months of harsh isolation

Climate actions need financing to achieve “a faster green recovery,” CAF's Díaz-Granados said

Latin America's Development Bank CAF and the World Bank’s Latin America and the Caribbean Region have pledged at COP-26 to join efforts to implement climate action strategies throughout, Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) countries, it was announced Friday.

This partnership will help LAC countries achieve their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), as well as the goals of the Paris Agreement in addition to Biodiversity targets agreed upon internationally. The partnership “will ramp up green financing to the region to better adapt to climate change, reduce emissions and make ecosystems more sustainable,” the two institutions said in a statement.

The partnership also seeks to aims to boost resilient growth to create greener and more inclusive post-COVID-19 economies, increase green financing to the region and encourage measures in key sectors, including agriculture, energy, forests, water, marine-coastal areas, urban development and sustainable cities, and disaster risk management, among other goals.

It is also aimed at promoting the participation of the private sector in the implementation and financing of actions in support of the Paris Agreement and the Global Biodiversity Framework as well as and improving the conservation of strategic ecosystems in the region, including the Amazon, wetlands, moors, and marine-coastal areas..

Climate change demands immediate actions to mitigate its potentially devastating effects, improve

resilience to climate related events and build greener and more sustainable economies, said Carlos

Felipe Jaramillo, World Bank Vice President for the Latin America, and Caribbean Region.

Coordinated actions and cooperation towards these common goals will allow for faster and better results that benefit all, he added.

CAF Executive President Sergio Díaz-Granados also pointed out that “Latin America and the Caribbean needs to address the unpostponable call for action to enhance all necessary measures aimed to climate mitigation and adaptation to assure timely resilience for climate extreme variability effects.”

“CAF and the World Bank will work closer, with a full commitment to increase national and regional capabilities towards a faster green recovery post COVID-19 and promote solid sustainable growth for the region,” he went on.



CAF is a multilateral financial institution committed to improving the quality of life of all the people in Latin American and the Caribbean. Sustainable development and regional integration are the institutional pillars shared with its 19 partner countries (17 from Latin America and the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal). CAF supports the region with financial operations and technical and financial structuring of projects for both the public and private sectors. CAF is committed to become the Green Bank of LAC.

5th Friday, November 2021 - 18:24 UTC Full article

The publication also called on EU and UK to pass their own laws “to halt deforestation embedded in their supply chains”

A leading British website dedicated to environmental issues has denounced Friday that Paraguay's allegiance to Glasgow's climate goals did not match President Mario Abdo's government policies regarding emissions and that the South American country intends to keep allowing deforestation.

According to www.earthsight.org.uk, “Paraguay’s climate pledges mask plans to green light rising deforestation until 2030.”

The website also labeled Paraguay as “one of the world’s worst countries for tropical deforestation” and insisted its change of heart at Glasgow was purely due to “public criticism.”

“Paraguay has persistently failed to stamp down on industrial clearance of the protected forests of an ‘uncontacted’ indigenous group for cattle ranching. Earthsight’s research has revealed how leather from cattle reared there has been making its way into luxury cars, including those made by BMW and Jaguar Land Rover,” the publication went on.

“Pledges by Paraguay to slash greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and support new initiatives to protect biodiversity ring hollow as its government looks willing to accept emissions from deforestation will continue to rise until at least 2030,” Earthsight insisted, because “Paraguay’s government is signalling to industry and the international community that it is acceptable for its already world-high deforestation rates to keep rising.” which “makes a mockery of its pledges to reduce climate emissions and protect biodiversity.”

Earthsight claims Paraguay’s forests are disappearing more rapidly than any other on earth and that in the last three decades, the country lost an area of forest larger than Switzerland. But all this is based on “some estimates” which were not disclosed. The website also denounced that Chaco forests belonging to the Ayoreo Totobiegosode indigenous people “were illegally cleared for cattle.”

The Ayoreo people have withdrawn from all negotiations with Abdo's administration despite the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights' mediation.

Earthsight linked the leather from the cattle bred in Paraguay to luxurious cars built in the northern hemisphere and called on markets such as the EU and UK to pass their own laws “to halt deforestation embedded in their supply chains” and regretted that the EU Commission’s legislative proposal to be published this month does not include leather in the list of commodities to be covered.

Paraguay was initially a signatory to the new Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (Fact) dialogue which proposes to implement a roadmap to reduce commodity-driven deforestation among 28 major producing and consuming nations. Run by the UK and co-chaired with Indonesia, Fact will focus on transparency and traceability, trade and markets, smallholder farmers, and research and innovation. But Paraguay was surprisingly absent from the list of 28 signatories to the Fact roadmap of action unveiled this week.

The publication also regretted there were no indigenous representatives as part of Paraguay’s delegation at Glasgow, which did include three delegates from agribusiness lobby groups.","Paraguay's Glasgow pledge “a mockery,” says British environmentalist website"

The G20 declaration was found vague and disappointing ahead of Glasgow's climate summit

Leaders of the G20 have issued their final statement Sunday at the end of a two-day summit, in which they pledged to increase efforts to reach the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a goal which is in line with a global commitment made in 2015 through the Paris Climate Accord.

As per those standards, countries have agreed on the need to keep global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius. “We recognize that the impacts of climate change at 1.5°C are much lower than at 2°C. Keeping 1.5°C within reach will require meaningful and effective actions and commitment by all countries,” the G20 document said.

Sunday's declaration was the result of days of a tough negotiation, and it leaves huge work to be done at the broader United Nations COP26 climate summit in Scotland, which starts this week. As they were ready to move on to Glasgow, the G20 leaders stressed the Paris targets needed to be achieved by or around mid-century. They also agreed to end public financing for coal-fired power generation abroad but set no target for phasing out coal domestically — a clear nod to top carbon polluters China and India.

The Group of 20 countries, which represent more than three-quarters of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, had been looking for common ground and solid commitments on how to reduce emissions while helping poor countries deal with the impact of rising temperatures. Without them, momentum could be lost for the larger annual talks in Glasgow that officially opened Sunday and where countries from around the globe will be represented, including poor ones most vulnerable to rising seas, desertification and other effects.

We must accelerate the phasing-out of coal and invest more in renewable energy, said Italian Premier Mario Draghi.

We also need to make sure that we use available resources wisely, which means that we should become able to adapt our technologies and also our lifestyles to this new world, he added.

The G20 also reaffirmed past commitments by rich countries to allocate US $ 100 billion annually to help poorer countries cope with climate change, and committed to scaling up financing.

The closing statement also highlighted G20 leaders will accelerate our actions across mitigation, adaptation and finance, acknowledging the key relevance of achieving global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions or carbon neutrality by or around mid-century.

But the expression “mid-century” opened up a plethora of interpretations. For some, it meant 2050 in the strict sense, while others believed that given the diversity of the G20 countries ... it means everyone agrees to a common goal while providing a bit of flexibility to take into account national diversity. Some countries have set 2050 as their deadline for net-zero emissions, while China, Russia and Saudi Arabia -the countries US President Joseph Biden criticized specifically- are aiming for 2060.

The future of coal, a key source of greenhouse gas emissions, has been one of the hardest things for the G20 to agree on. At the Rome summit, leaders agreed to put an end to the provision of international public finance for new unabated coal power generation abroad by the end of 2021.

That refers to financial support for building coal plants abroad, something Western countries have been moving away from and major Asian economies is now doing the same: Chinese President Xi Jinping announced at the U.N. General Assembly last month that Beijing would stop funding such projects, and Japan and South Korea made similar commitments earlier in the year.

The failure of the G20 to set a target for phasing out domestic coal use was a blow to Britain, which had hoped there would be progress on the issue at COP26, although the UK is still expected to push for ambitious commitments at Glasgow, it was reported.

While Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and French President Emmanuel Macron described the G20 as a success, the outcome disappointed the chief of the UN as well as the leader of the United Kingdom.

Draghi said the declaration went further on climate than any G20 statement before it. He noted that it referred to limiting global warming at the 1.5C threshold that scientists say is vital to avoid disaster. “We changed the goalposts,” Draghi told reporters.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the G-20’s commitments were mere “drops in a rapidly warming ocean,” and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres agreed the outcome was not enough.

“While I welcome the #G20′s recommitment to global solutions, I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled – but at least they are not buried,” Guterres tweeted. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau concurred: “There’s no question that Canada, along with several other countries, would have liked the stronger language and stronger commitments on the fight against climate change than others,” he said.

Youth climate activists Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate issued an open letter to the media as the G20 was wrapping up. The climate crisis is only going to become more urgent. We can still avoid the worst consequences, we can still turn this around. But not if we continue like today, they wrote, just weeks after Thunberg shamed global leaders for their blah blah blah rhetoric during a youth climate summit in Milan.

El encuentro virtual llega en un momento de crecientes tensiones entre los dos países

Los presidentes de China, Xi Jinping, y de Estados Unidos, Joseph Biden, celebrarán una cumbre virtual este próximo lunes para tratar temas bilaterales, en particular el caso de Taiwán, un país independiente que aún es considerada una provincia rebelde por el gigante asiático.

Xi se ha comprometido a reincorporar a Taiwán al territorio chino, mientras que Biden ha anunciado que Estados Unidos defenderá la isla. Los temas en curso en Hong Kong también estarán en la agenda, se informó.

En este escenario volátil, el presidente chino advirtió este jueves contra el fomento de una Guerra Fría en la región Asia-Pacífico, que no debe recaer en la confrontación y división de la era de la Guerra Fría.

A medida que aumentaba la tensión en los últimos meses, EE UU ha establecido una alianza estratégica en la región con Australia y el Reino Unido que involucra submarinos nucleares. A principios de este año, Biden dijo que Estados Unidos y China estaban en una competencia para ganar el siglo XXI, mientras lanzaban todos los ataques diplomáticos posibles contra Beijing, desde el comercio hasta los abusos contra los derechos humanos. Taiwán es uno de esos problemas pendientes.

Biden dijo recientemente que Estados Unidos defenderá a Taiwán y el secretario de Estado Antony Blinken insistió el miércoles en que su país y sus aliados tomarán medidas si Beijing ataca a Taiwán.

Sin embargo, Estados Unidos y China han anunciado un compromiso conjunto el miércoles de trabajar juntos para abordar la crisis climática, en medio de crecientes temores de que ambos países desarrollen armas hipersónicas capaces de evadir todas las defensas conocidas y portar ojivas nucleares.

El lunes será la primera reunión de Biden con Xi desde que asumió el cargo en enero. Ambos líderes han enviado cartas al Comité Nacional de Relaciones entre Estados Unidos y China esta semana en conmemoración de su 55 aniversario, lo que indica su disposición a mantener un diálogo a pesar de las tensiones.

El embajador de China en EE. UU., Qin Gang, leyó la misiva de Xi en una cena para la ocasión el martes y dijo: Xi enfatizó que siguiendo los principios de respeto mutuo, coexistencia pacífica y cooperación de beneficio mutuo, China está lista para trabajar con EE UU y mejorar los intercambios y la cooperación en todos los ámbitos, abordar conjuntamente los problemas regionales e internacionales, así como los desafíos globales y, mientras tanto, gestionar adecuadamente las diferencias, a fin de que las relaciones entre China y EE UU vuelvan a la senda correcta de un desarrollo sólido y constante.

También se espera que Biden y Xi se dirijan a los líderes de la Cuenca del Pacífico a última hora del viernes. China marcó la pauta para la reunión de la Cooperación Económica Asia Pacífico (APEC) de los 21 miembros esta semana, y Xi advirtió en una grabación de video este jueves que la región no debe volver a las tensiones de la era de la Guerra Fría. Por otro lado, se espera que Biden se concentre en la pandemia de COVID-19 y la recuperación económica global.

La reunión de APEC se produce antes de la cumbre virtual entre Biden y Xi, mientras las superpotencias buscan evitar que las crecientes tensiones entre las dos economías más grandes del mundo se conviertan en un conflicto. También se espera que el presidente de Rusia, Vladimir Putin, y el primer ministro canadiense, Justin Trudeau, hablen en la reunión.

APEC es la última reunión multilateral del año y se produce después de una serie de encuentros, incluida la cumbre del G20 en Roma y la reunión sobre el clima COP26 en Glasgow, Escocia. APEC se llevará a cabo en Tailandia el próximo año. Estados Unidos se ha ofrecido a albergar la ronda 2023 de reuniones de APEC por primera vez en más de una década, aunque no se ha llegado a un consenso sobre esta propuesta, dijeron los funcionarios.",Xi y Biden celebrarán cumbre virtual el próximo lunes

Nuestro objetivo no es pequeño, nuestra ambición no es modesta, dijo Jørgensen

Un grupo de países y territorios liderados por Dinamarca y Costa Rica han decidido unir fuerzas para lograr un mundo libre de combustibles fósiles en cumplimiento del Acuerdo de París bajo un grupo denominado Alianza Más Allá del Petróleo y el Gas (o BOGA, por su acrónimo en inglés - Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance).

El anuncio se hizo en Glasgow, donde la Cumbre de la COP26 sobre el clima de la ONU se acerca a su fin. Además de los países inspiradores, BOGA también cuenta con los siguientes miembros plenos: Francia, Groenlandia, Irlanda, Quebec, Suecia y Gales.

La alianza se ha comprometido a eliminar gradualmente la producción de petróleo y gas, para lo cual aún resta establecer una fecha objetivo. Portugal, California y Nueva Zelanda también se han unido a la alianza como miembros asociados.

Por su parte, Italia expresó su apoyo a la coalición al convertirse en “Amigo de BOGA” y se están llevando a cabo negociaciones para incorporar nuevos miembros. Se esperan anuncios sobre este tema se hicieran en breve.

Cada miembro se comprometerá a poner fin a las nuevas rondas de licencias para la exploración y producción de petróleo y gas. También deben establecer una fecha de finalización para la producción y exploración de petróleo y gas que esté alineada con los objetivos del Acuerdo de París.

Nuestro objetivo no es pequeño, nuestra ambición no es modesta, dijo Dan Jørgensen, Ministro de Clima, Energía y Servicios Públicos de Dinamarca. Esperamos que hoy marque el comienzo del fin del petróleo y el gas, agregó.

Nosotros, los 11 gobiernos fundadores, hemos decidido ir más allá del petróleo y el gas, prosiguió el ministro. No respondemos a este llamado por la emoción del desafío; lo hacemos porque realmente creemos que lo necesitamos. No estamos dispuestos a aceptar las consecuencias si no lo hacemos, explicó también Jørgensen.

Se dice que BOGA fue diseñada para llenar un vacío en la cumbre climática de la ONU, cuyo borrador de declaración final hace solo una breve mención de los combustibles fósiles, a pesar de su papel fundamental en la crisis climática.

El documento fundacional de BOGA establece que los compromisos climáticos estaban siendo socavados por la producción actual y planificada de combustibles fósiles, que tendría que caer entre el 3% (gas natural) y el 4% (petróleo) por año para 2030, y a tasas más altas a partir de entonces, para asegurar un calentamiento global máximo de 1,5ºC este siglo desde los niveles preindustriales”.

Los planes actuales de los gobiernos, sin embargo, apuntan a un aumento del 2% anual en la producción de combustibles fósiles. En 2030, esto resultaría en más del doble de la producción consistente con el límite de 1,5 grados, dijo BOGA.

Además, la Agencia Internacional de Energía señaló que la demanda de petróleo y gas natural debe caer un 75% y un 55%, respectivamente, entre 2020 y 2050 para asegurar el objetivo de cero emisiones de CO2 para mediados de siglo. Esto significa que no necesitamos nuevos campos de petróleo y gas que no sean los ya aprobados hasta 2021.",Crean en Glasgow un grupo para terminar con los combustibles fósiles

En caso de prosperar la iniciativa, el ministro del Interior, Rodrigo Delgado, asumirá la presidencia por el resto del mandato de Piñera.

El debate parlamentario duró alrededor de 22 horas.

La Cámara Baja de Chile aprobó este martes una moción para acusar al presidente Sebastián Piñera por su participación en el asunto de la empresa minera Dominga, sobre el cual se informó en los llamados Pandora Papers.

Ahora dependerá del Senado decidir sobre la suerte del presidente, que no ha sido suspendido de sus funciones a pesar del resultado de la votación en la Cámara de Diputados.

La transacción de Dominga se llevó a cabo en el paraíso fiscal de las Islas Vírgenes Británicas.

Los legisladores obtuvieron 78 votos, suficientes para aprobar la moción, mientras que otros 67 diputados se pronunciaron en contra de buscar la destitución de Piñera. También hubo 3 abstenciones.

El abogado de Piñera, Jorge Gálvez, había rogado a los “honorables diputados, que rechacen esta injusta e inadmisible acusación constitucional”, pero fue en vano.

Al llegar a esta decisión luego de un debate que duró alrededor de 22 horas, la Cámara Baja entendió que Piñera violó abiertamente la Constitución y otras leyes, además de poner en peligro el honor de la nación.

En una jornada de deliberaciones que duró casi 22 horas, los legisladores aprobaron con 78 votos a favor, 67 en contra y tres abstenciones que la acusación constitucional vaya al Senado, que votará al respecto a días de las elecciones presidenciales del 21 de noviembre.

El diputado socialista Jaime Naranjo se tomó 15 horas para leer la acusación en su totalidad. Destacó que Piñera había fallado al principio de probidad y comprometió seriamente el honor de la Nación.

Naranjo resumió su discurso diciendo “Espero que esta Cámara apruebe la acusación constitucional, pero (...) Chile juzgará a quienes están permitiendo esta impunidad en el país”, enfatizó.

Para que la iniciativa avanzara se necesitaban 77 votos, mientras que la destitución de Piñera por parte del Senado requiere de dos tercios de la Cámara Alta.

Gálvez también insistió en que esta decisión fue motivada políticamente por la proximidad de las próximas elecciones e instó a rechazar el texto acusatorio, por considerarlo inadmisible y estimar que se trata de un golpe a la institucionalidad, además de una maniobra político-electoral.

En el Senado, se necesitarán dos tercios de los votos para destituir al mandatario, a quien se le ha prohibido salir del país. En caso de prosperar la iniciativa, el ministro del Interior, Rodrigo Delgado, asumirá la presidencia por el resto del mandato de Piñera.

La acusación constitucional fue presentada por un grupo de parlamentarios opositores luego de que se conocieran los Pandora Papers relacionados con la venta del proyecto minero Dominga por parte de la familia Piñera Morel a su amigo Carlos Délano. La transacción se realizó en el paraíso fiscal de las Islas Vírgenes Británicas en 2010 después de que Piñera asumiera el cargo por primera vez. En el contrato revelado por la investigación periodística mundial se conoció la existencia de una cláusula que condicionaba el tercer pago a plazos de Dominga a que el sector no fuera declarado santuario de la naturaleza, lo que en última instancia depende del Consejo de Ministros.



Luego de una sesión maratónica de 22 horas continuas desde el lunes por la mañana, la oposición logró mantener activo al Congreso hasta que se obtuvieron suficientes votos.

El diputado opositor socialista Jaime Naranjo, quien actuó como relator de la Cámara, tardó unas 15 horas en delinear las presuntas fechorías presidenciales que a su juicio justifican el juicio político.

Después del largo discurso de Naranjo, que terminó alrededor de la 1.30 am del martes, el abogado de Piñera, Jorge Gálvez, intentó sin éxito defender al jefe de Estado, alegando que un comité de investigación era la solución más lógica y no el juicio político.

El Senado tendrá que votar, muy probablemente este viernes 12 de noviembre, para decidir si el jefe de Estado debe ser destituido de su cargo, para lo cual se necesitarán 29 votos.

Para agregar a una atmósfera acalorada, el diputado demócrata cristiano Jorge Sabag tenía síntomas de Covid, aunque viajó desde Chillán (400 kilómetros al sur de Santiago) a pesar de tener pendiente una prueba de PCR, generando polémica tanto por su presencia como por la de la Secretaría de Salud de Valparaíso, que llegó al lugar pasada la medianoche.

Naranjo también destacó la decisión de la oposición de permitirle leer el documento en nombre de todos los legisladores que estaban a favor de acusar al jefe de Estado.

“Lo que hicimos hoy tiene una sola explicación, la unidad de la oposición y la generosidad de la oposición para permitirme liderar algo que yo había planteado que algunos no entendían”, explicó Naranjo, quien señaló que habló con fundamentos, con seriedad y responsabilidad porque una acusación constitucional es una cosa muy grave y ustedes fueron testigos de que di fundamentos serios sobre por qué tenía que ser aprobado el impeachment.

Naranjo destacó que lo más importante que hoy esta oposición ha enviado un mensaje de esperanza, de fe a los chilenos, que se puede construir un país mucho mejor, que tengamos un presidente que sea ejemplo y no como la situación en la que nos vemos hoy: con un presidente que no solo ha actuado fuera de la integridad administrativa que se requiere, sino que también ha actuado seriamente en dañar la imagen de la nación”.

Sabemos que es difícil conseguir votos en el Senado. Será nuestro trabajo convencer a los senadores. Tenemos fe y esperanza, agregó.",Diputados chilenos coinciden en que Piñera debe ir a juicio político ante el Senado

La baja demanda de Brasil provocó la salida de Lifan

La automotriz china Lifan anunció que detendría todas sus operaciones en Uruguay y se iría del país luego de acordar pagar los salarios vencidos a unos 60 trabajadores que fueron despedidos y que ya cuentan con el seguro de desempleo.

La empresa realizará una subasta de maquinaria, repuestos y mercadería para recaudar fondos para tal fin.

El dirigente sindical Rubén Villafan dijo a El Observador que la decisión se tomó durante una reunión en el Ministerio de Trabajo con representantes de la empresa, incluidos algunos ejecutivos que participaron virtualmente desde China. La decisión implica el despido de unos 60 trabajadores que habían estado acogidos al seguro de desempleo durante unos tres años.

La empresa también anunció que planea realizar una subasta de maquinaria, repuestos y mercadería en la planta de San José para financiar estos pagos. Según Villafan, estos activos tienen un valor de entre US $ 1 millón y 1,5 millones, muy por encima de los fondos necesarios para los acuerdos.

Nunca habían hablado de salir del país al margen de las dificultades de la región. Y fue peor cuando nos dijeron que no tenían todos los activos para pagarnos. En una subasta dependemos de un tercero. Si todo esto no se vende, ¿cómo lo hacemos?, preguntó Villafan.

En este escenario, el sindicato de trabajadores prevé solicitar al ministro de Trabajo, Pablo Mieres, una nueva prórroga del seguro de desempleo hasta que se pague efectivamente la indemnización.

Según los informes, Lifan se ha unido al grupo Geely y se cree que la decisión de abandonar Uruguay está vinculada a nuevos planes comerciales centrados en reposicionar la marca como fabricante de automóviles eléctricos.

La planta de Lifan en Uruguay se inauguró en 2011. Dejó de producir a mediados de 2018 debido a la pérdida de competitividad en el mercado brasileño, principal destino de sus exportaciones.

Antes del primer cierre temporal de la planta en 2015, luego del colapso del mercado brasileño, Lifan alcanzó una producción anual de 6.400 vehículos. Las operaciones se reanudaron en 2017 con una meta anual de 1.700 vehículos, pero en 2018 la marca que en algún momento había contratado a unos 400 trabajadores simplemente dejó de intentar.",Fabricante de automóviles chino detendrá operaciones en Uruguay

Brazil was represented at Glasgow by Environment Minister Joaquim Leite

Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro insisted his country was a part of the solution and not of the problem of climate change. Bolsonaro's remarks came after the participation of Environment Minister Joaquim Leite in a side event at the UN COP 26 Climate Change Summit in Glasgow, which the Brazilian head of state chose not to attend and stay in Italy instead.

Under Bolsonaro, indiscriminate logging of the Amazon grew to favor agribusiness, making Brazil one of the 5 countries to have worsened global warming the most.

But the President trusts his country, which owns 60% of the Amazon rainforest, according to a recorded message broadcast on public TV.

Brazil is part of the solution to overcome this global challenge. The results achieved up to 2020 show that we can be more ambitious, Bolsonaro said in a message recorded last week.

The President explained that his Government's the national Green Growth plan encourages attracting investments to renewable economy by creating jobs in sustainable activities.

Minister Leite's announcement in Glasgow, nevertheless, lacked details about the execution of such plan.

Today we present a new climate goal, more ambitious, going from 43% to 50% until 2030 of gas reduction, and of carbon neutrality until 2050, something that will be formalized at COP26, Leite said in his speech.

Brazil is under international pressure as a result of the legislation that Bolsonaro seeks to pass to allow cattle ranching, agriculture and mining in Amazonian indigenous reserves, after he increased deforestation for illegal activities since he took office in 2019.

Environmentalists lashed out at Leite's speech, on the grounds that that there was no actual program to implement these reductions and that Brazil has recalculated its goals without taking into account former President Dilma Rousseff's pledge in the 2015 Paris Agreement.

If Brazil wants to present a commitment to the Country Agreement, the goal should be 80% reduction, said the Climate Observatory entity.

25th Thursday, November 2021 - 09:35 UTC Full article

The report comes is timely, ahead of President Biden’s Summit for Democracy, when 100 countries will gather to discuss the challenges facing democracy.

The world is becoming more authoritarian as autocratic regimes become even more brazen in their repression. Many democratic governments are backsliding and are adopting authoritarian tactics by restricting free speech and weakening the rule of law, a trend exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.

These are the key findings of the Global State of Democracy Report 2021--Building Resilience in a Pandemic Era, published this week by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA), an intergovernmental organization based in Stockholm. The report comes at a timely moment—ahead of US President Joe Biden’s Summit for Democracy on 9-10 December, when around 100 countries will gather to discuss the challenges facing democracy.

“The Global State of Democracy report is not a wakeup call, it’s an alarm bell. Authoritarianism advances in every corner of the earth. Universal values – the pillars of civilization that protect the most vulnerable – are under threat. The EU shares many of the challenges. But we do have a unique and diverse experience of democracy. Our Team Europe Democracy (TED) Initiative, that we are launching today, brings EU and member states’ democracy support together for the first time. We will not weather this storm divided, and we will learn as well as teach. We need Global Action for Democracy and the EU will play its part including at the upcoming Summit for Democracy”, said Jutta Urpilainen.

The number of backsliding democracies has doubled in the past decade, now accounting for a quarter of the world’s population. This includes established democracies such as the United States, but also EU Member States such as Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. More than two-thirds of the world’s population now live in backsliding democracies or autocratic regimes.

Overall, the number of countries moving in an authoritarian direction in 2020 outnumbered those going in a democratic direction.

The world has lost at least four democracies in the last two years, either through flawed elections or military coups. The Global State of Democracy (GSoD) indices show that authoritarian regimes have increased their repression, with 2020 being the worst year on record.

The Covid-19 pandemic has deepened the trend of democratic deterioration—As of August 2021, 64 percent of countries have taken an action deemed to be disproportionate, unnecessary or illegal to curb the pandemic.

But democratic erosion is not a one-way street. Many democracies have proved resilient, including during the Covid-19 pandemic, by introducing or expanding democratic innovations and adapting their practices and institutions in record time.

“The political flaws and social fault lines revealed by the pandemic will drive more people towards populist and authoritarian leaders that seldom deliver durable solutions for the concerns of citizens”, said International IDEA Secretary-General Kevin Casas-Zamora. “If there is one key message in this Report, it is that this is the time for democracies to be bold, to innovate and revitalize themselves.”

The Report finds that many countries held credible elections in exceedingly difficult conditions created by the pandemic, often by expanding the modalities to exercise suffrage. Nonetheless, International IDEA warns against the grave and looming threat of disinformation and baseless accusations of electoral fraud, as seen in Myanmar, Peru and the United States.

One of the key findings of this research is the remarkable strength of civic activism all over the world. Pro-democracy movements have braved repression in places such as Belarus, Cuba, Eswatini, Myanmar, and Sudan, and global social movements for tackling climate change and fighting racial injustice have thrived. More than 80 countries have experienced protests and civic action of different kinds during the pandemic despite often harsh government restrictions.

To conclude, the Report recommends a series of policy actions to bolster global democratic renewal by embracing more equitable and sustainable social contracts, reforming existing political institutions, and shoring up defenses against democratic backsliding and authoritarianism.

THE AMERICAS

Half the democracies in the region have suffered democratic erosion, including notable declines in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador and the United States.

Still, most democracies have been resilient to the disruptive effects of the pandemic, with most elections going ahead and parliaments, judiciaries and media managing to exercise their functions of oversight. The Dominican Republic and Ecuador are notable for the considerable progress made in the quality of their democracies.

EUROPE

The pandemic has placed a strain on democracy. In some countries where democratic principles were already under threat, it provided an excuse for governments to weaken democracy further.

Ongoing democratic backsliding intensified in EU Member States Hungary and Poland, while Slovenia joined them as the region’s third backsliding democracy in 2020. Europe’s non-democratic governments—Azerbaijan, Belarus, Russia and Turkey have intensified their already very repressive practices.

ASIA AND THE PACIFIC

The continent has suffered a wave of growing authoritarianism as crises of various kinds have affected Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Myanmar. Democratic erosion is also widespread, including in India, the Philippines and Sri Lanka with many of them suffering from rising ethno-nationalism and the militarization of politics. China’s influence, coupled with its own deepening autocratization, also puts the legitimacy of the democratic model at risk.

AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST

Recent declines in democracy in Africa have undermined remarkable progress made across the continent over the past three decades. The Covid-19 pandemic, though seemingly less damaging to public health than elsewhere in the world, has added pressure on governments to respond to concerns regarding governance, rights and social inequality.

While regular elections remain the norm, the democratic quality of these elections is on the decline and attempts to evade or remove presidential term limits present a risk to democracy. Moreover, the year has seen four successful military coups in Chad, Guinea-Conakry, Mali and Sudan.

The Middle East’s tainted track record on protecting civil liberties was even further strained by the pandemic, with many elections held with the sole aim of keeping existing regimes in power, such as in Algeria, Egypt and Syria.","Backsliding democracies challenged as world becomes more authoritarian, IDEA report"

“The fourth wave is here in full force,” said Spahn.

Germany's Health Minister Jens Spahn said his country was going through a “pandemic of the unvaccinated” and called for measures to curb the peak of coronavirus cases registered over the past few days.

Currently, we are experiencing an essentially unvaccinated pandemic, and it is massive, he said, noting that intensive care beds were in short supply once again, after occupancy last week was merely 15%. This is not about harassment of the unvaccinated, but about avoiding saturation of the health system, he said.

Meanwhile, the Society of German Hospitals has reported hospitalizations of seriously ill patients with COVID-19 went up 40% in seven days.

The fourth wave of the pandemic is advancing, as we feared because the number of vaccinated people is not enough, confirmed Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch epidemiological surveillance institute, and regretted that sanitary measures were not respected at public places.

In one day there are again more than 100 deaths. The numbers are worrying, Wieler added.

The fourth wave occurs exactly as we imagined, precisely because many did not get vaccinated, he claimed.

Germany has registered an increase in covid-19 cases in recent days. On Wednesday, more than 20,000 new cases were registered in 24 hours and 194 deaths, according to official figures.

Spahn has requested local authorities at each jurisdiction to tighten up the rules on the unvaccinated in the event of an increase in infections. The minister also pointed out he wanted to speed up the booster vaccines, which are now recommended for those over 70 years of age, six months after completing the first cycle.

The minister is inspired by Israel, which managed to lower the contagion curve thanks to the third dose. He insisted that in some regions, intensive care beds are again insufficient, and that the pandemic is far from over.

“The fourth wave is here in full force. We are living a pandemic of the unvaccinated and it is massive, with increasing numbers of contagion, he concluded.

Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed her concern over the latest developments and said she was very sorry to see that between two and three million Germans over 60 have not yet been vaccinated.”

According to data from the Robert Koch Institute, 66.8% of the population, that is, 55.6 million people in Germany, are fully vaccinated.",Germany going through a “pandemic of the unvaxxed”

For 15 years, researchers studied a population of 15,500 breeding couples in the Falklands, and in effect only 1 to 3% of couples would separate after picking a partner (Pic OceanWide Exp.)

A recent Royal Society study shows climate change and rising oceans are pushing black-browed albatross breakup rates higher. Among the world's most devoted monogamous species, they are “divorcing” more frequently. For 15 years, researchers studied a wild population of 15,500 breeding couples in the Falkland Islands, and in effect, only 1 to 3% of couples would separate after picking a partner to pursue more romantic pastures.

However, when water temperatures were abnormally warm, that figure continuously climbed, with up to 8% of couples divorcing. Warmer waters bring fewer fish, less food, and a stricter habitat for seabirds. Some fewer females survive. The stress hormones in the birds rise. They are compelled to hunt further afield

Albatross love lives have long focused on scientific research since they are some of the most devoted couples in the animal kingdom. There are all these creatures we think of as being super-human, says Dr Graeme Elliot, chief science adviser at New Zealand's department of conservation, who has spent the last three decades researching albatrosses in the country's oceans.

The birds lend themselves to anthropomorphism: they live for 50-60 years, go through a protracted, awkward adolescent phase in which they learn how to attract a partner through dancing, and travel for years at a time as they grow. They usually mate for life, making a big deal out of welcoming a spouse after a long time apart.

However, they are increasingly sharing another rite of passage that may sound similar to young humans: some are fighting to sustain relationships while under stress from the climate catastrophe, working longer hours to eat, and dealing with the logistical obstacles of travelling with a partner.

Even when the lack of food was considered, researchers were shocked to see that warmer seas were connected with exceptionally high rates of albatross couples splitting up, according to Francesco Ventura, a researcher at the University of Lisbon co-author of the Royal Society paper.

According to Ventura, albatross divorce is generally preceded by reproductive failure. If a couple was unable to have a check, they were more likely to break up. More failures may result from a lack of food for birds. However, even after accounting for this, the researchers discovered that greater water temperatures had an additional effect, increasing divorce rates even when reproduction was successful.

Ventura proposed two theories: one, that warmer seas were driving the birds to hunt for longer periods and fly farther, and the other, that the birds were being forced to hunt for longer periods and flee further. If the birds do not return for the following mating season, their spouses may move on to someone else. Furthermore, albatross stress hormones rise in warmer seas and harsher settings. According to Ventura, the birds may feel this way and blame their companion.

We offer this partner-blaming hypothesis, he adds, in which a worried female may experience physiological stress and attribute increased stress levels to the male's poor performance.

The study comes at a time when many albatross populations throughout the world are in peril. Their numbers are dwindling, Elliot observes. The people of wandering albatrosses that he examines have been diminishing at a 5-10 per cent rate per year since roughly 2005. Less prey, warmer oceans, and more interactions with tuna line-fishing boats, which mistakenly catch and kill the birds, contribute to the decline in numbers.

Showing Homosexual Behaviors

The birds' mating practices were shifting in other ways due to the population decline, Elliot added, with more same-sex partnerships developing. On Antipodes Island, we're seeing male-male couples among the birds, which we haven't seen previously, he added. Because they can't find a female companion, a small percentage of the boys hook up with another boy.

The Royal Society study focused on a group of black-browed albatrosses in the Falkland Islands, where numbers were still high, and divorce was not disastrous, according to Ventura - birds could find new companions. However, he believes that the same dynamics might apply to other albatross populations, with a greater devastating effect in areas where bird populations are more vulnerable. If we're talking about a population with a lot fewer breeding partners, then the breakup of a link might potentially cause some disruption in the regular breeding operations, he added.

Elliot now hopes that some of the sympathy people have for albatrosses may encourage people to modify their behaviour to address the environmental concerns the birds face, such as climate change and tuna fishing. To conserve these birds, we need a worldwide campaign, Elliot adds. If we don't do something, they'll go extinct.",Research done in Falklands shows albatrosses are “divorcing” because of climate change

The world needs the US, Europe, China, India, Russia, Indonesia, South Africa and Brazil leading on climate actions, the former US leader said

Former US President Barack Obama Monday protested the world was “too far” from the goals set at the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate action. “We are nowhere near where we should be,” Obama told the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), in Glasgow, Scotland.

“To begin with, despite the progress that (the) Paris Agreement has made, most countries did not comply with the plans established six years ago,” he added.

Time is running out: we have made important progress since the Paris Agreement, but we must do more, both collectively and individually, he went on.

The former Democratic head of state also pointed out that what small island states are going through these days heralded imminent disasters. “If we don't act, it will be too late, he insisted.

Obama also said “we all have a role to play, we all have a job to do, we all have sacrifices to do. Those of us who are richer have contributed to aggravating the problem and that is why now we have an extra weight to bear to help and assist those less responsible or less capable, but at the same time the most vulnerable to the effects of the climate crisis.

The former leader also lashed out at Donald Trump. In the United States -explained Obama- some of the progress in the fight against climate change came to a halt when my successor decided to unilaterally withdraw from the Paris Agreement during the first year of his mandate.

The impatience of young people is vital to push world leaders to take action to address the climate emergency and ensure that the commitment to contain global warming to within 1.5 degrees above expectations is maintained,” Obama added.

The former US president said real progress had been achieved this year at Glasgow. They are not enough, but they are advances, said Obama, who also pointed out that “it was particularly discouraging to see the leaders of two of the largest emitters, China and Russia, refuse even to participate in the program, and their national plans reflect what appears to be a dangerous absence of urgency: the desire to maintain a status quo, he went on.

This, he continued, is a shame. We need advanced economies like the United States and Europe to lead this problem, but we also need China and India, Russia and Indonesia, South Africa and Brazil. We cannot afford anyone on the sidelines.

But Obama's words also received an onslaught, When I was 13 years old, in 2009, you pledged $ 100 billion to finance the fight against climate change. The United States has betrayed its promises, this will cost the loss of lives in Africa, said activist Vanessa Nakate on Twitter.

The richest country in the world does not contribute enough to the funds to save lives. You want to meet the youth of COP26, we want the facts,” she elaborated.

Barack Obama warned attendees at the COP26 summit that the world was “collectively and individually... falling short” in tackling the climate crisis. The 60-year-old Obama also pointed out that “we have not done nearly enough to address this crisis, we are going to have to do more and whether that happens or not to a large degree is going to depend on you – not just you in this room, but anybody who’s watching or reading a transcript of what I’m saying here today.”

Obama also expressed thankfulness for what could be done during the Donald Trump years while the US had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, thanks to “the determination of our state and local governments, along with the regulations and investment that my administration had already put in place, we were able to keep moving forward despite hostility from the White House.”

Mr Obama said the election of his close friend President Joe Biden and the rejoining of the Paris accords meant that the US “is back” in the fight against climate change and that the country would now act “more boldly”.

“We need advanced economies like the US and Europe leading on this issue, but you know the facts – we need China and India leading on this issue. We need Russia leading on this issue, just as we need Indonesia and South Africa and Brazil leading on this issue,” Obama insisted.

Keeping global temperature rises limited to 1.5ºC “will not be easy,” he also warned.",Obama says world is nowhere near Paris Agreement goals

Santos received the 2016 Peace Prize for the FARC deal

Former Colombian President and Nobel Peace Prize winner Juan Manuel Santos Wednesday said the current administration headed by Iván Duque is interested in striking a peace deal with the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional - ELN) guerrillas.

Santos, who brokered the peace accord with the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) five years ago, said Duque would only move forward with a dialogue proposal after the ELN drops all criminal activities because in the current President's view it would be a mockery against his country to negotiate with a group which commits murders and kidnappings daily.

Negotiations with the ELN had been undertaken in the past but were dropped by the Government in January 2019 after an attack against a police academy.

I understand that President Duque is exploring ways to resume peace talks with the ELN, Santos said during an event to commemorate the five years since the signing of the peace agreement with the FARC. The former head of state also said he supported these new talks and hoped the United Nations would too.

Peace does not belong to anyone in particular, but all Colombians and the entire world and for it, we must work together until the end of our days, Santos insisted.

Meanwhile, Duque has insisted reaching peace requires a commitment that is not verbal or discursive, and that implies the liberation of all those kidnapped and putting an end to criminal acts.

But pretending to speak of peace while assassinating and kidnapping is a mockery of the Colombia that builds peace every day.

High Commissioner for Peace, Juan Camilo Restrepo insisted ”we have said it over and over again, that said armed group (the ELN) organized outside the law [needs to] cease its criminal activities, cease all kidnappings, cease the installation of antipersonnel mines, cease the recruitment of minors, cease its activities in the chain of drug trafficking, for any peace negotiation to move forward.

When this happens, the Colombian government is ready to take the appropriate steps, Restrepo explained.

Peace talks with the ELN began already under Santos administration, but Duque decided to halt them following the attack on the General Santander Cadet School on January 17, 2019, which left 23 people dead. Since then, Colombia has requested the extradition of ELN leaders such as Gabino” who were in Cuba at the time of the attack.

Santos' words came Wednesday during a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of their FARC deal which was also attended by United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres.",Former Colombian leader says gov't seeks to resume peace talks with ELN

Annex C will still be up for dicsussion at a new meeting between Abdo and Bolsonaro over the next few days

Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro Wednesday did not concede an iota of what his Paraguayan counterpart Mario Abdo Benítez was seeking during a bilateral Summit in Brasilia to discuss Annex C of the Itaipú agreement regarding fees.

Abdo confirmed they had spoken about the revision of Itaipu's Annex C but no progress had been achieved and therefore no agreement could be announced on the Itaipu rate which Brazil insists on lowering while Paraguay is in favour of keeping it at current levels.

Brazil is going through an electricity supply crisis amid an unprecedented drought and subsequent downspout of its rivers which also has an impact on Paraguay's exports by ship.

In this scenario, Abdo and Bolsonaro met as Itaipu's contracting parties for the first time to seek a political solution, but talks remained within a middle ground, according to Abdo.

Paraguay insists on maintaining the 2020 and 2021 tariff of US $ 22.60 per kW of contracted monthly power, to take advantage of the resources that this generates in the strengthening of the electrical infrastructure; while Brazil argues that Annex C of the Agreement should be applied and thus lower the rate to US $ 18 per each monthly kW since the debt for the construction of the hydroelectric plant will be reduced and consequently the rate should fall.

“It was a work meeting, where we have been able to advance. We have been in an intermission room to continue advancing in all the conversations,” Abdo said afterwards. Negotiations with Brazil are monitored under a magnifying glass after Itaipu's secret act almost cost Abdo his position in 2019.

Bolsonaro also acknowledged they had discussed Annex C, but preferred to praise the infrastructure works between the two countries, such as the Integration Bridge (President Franco-Foz de Yguazú). The Brazilian head of state also announced that in the next few days he will be meeting with Abdo once again in the Paraguayan city of Carmelo Peralta to sign the contract for the start of works on the bridge linking it to Porto Murtinho in Brazil. Annexe C is also to be addressed at that meeting.

Abdo also highlighted the importance of that bridge in the development of the Bioceanic Road Corridor, whereby Mercosur goods will have straight access to ports on the Pacific coast.

Both leaders also praised current joint efforts in the fight against organized crime. Earlier this month, Brazil has donated two helicopters to the Paraguayan police.",Presidents of Brazil and Paraguay meet in Brasilia but reach no agreement on Itaipú rates

El presidente Fernández destacó el concepto de “deuda ambiental”

El presidente argentino, Alberto Fernández, compareció este martes ante la Cumbre COP26 de Cambio Climático de Glasgow con la misma propuesta que hizo días antes en Roma durante la Cumbre del G20.

Fernández insistió en un canje de deuda por acción climática ante el plenario de la Cumbre de Líderes de la Conferencia de Naciones Unidas y volvió a apuntar al FMI para llegar a una solidaridad ambiental, que sirva para ampliar los plazos de las deudas y la aplicación de tasas más bajas.

El jefe de Estado argentino se mostró particularmente interesado en vincular los mecanismos de pago de la deuda con las acciones ambientales y el compromiso de Argentina con la agenda verde.

Fernández propuso crear mecanismos de pago por servicios ecosistémicos y ratificó el compromiso de Argentina con el Acuerdo de París.

El mandatario también dijo que favorece la aplicación de los Derechos Especiales de Giro (DEG) del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI) a un gran pacto de solidaridad ambiental y destacó la necesidad de comprometer contribuciones concretas, en el marco del principio de responsabilidades comunes pero diferenciadas, las cuales van acompañadas de los medios para su implementación”.

“Debemos crear mecanismos de pago por servicios ecosistémicos, canjear deuda por acción climática e instalar el concepto de deuda ambiental”, dijo Fernández.

Debemos fortalecer el multilateralismo ambiental y promover la capitalización de los Bancos Regionales de Desarrollo, agregó.

El presidente también señaló que Argentina estaba haciendo el luchar contra el cambio climático “una política de estado”.

Fernández se comprometió asimismo a implementar medidas profundas para erradicar la deforestación ilegal, calificándola de delito ambiental.

También dijo que enviaría al Congreso un nuevo proyecto de Ley de Presupuestos Mínimos para la Protección Ambiental de los Bosques Nativos, además de perseguir el “tratamiento parlamentario de la Ley Federal de Educación Ambiental”.

Según Fernández, se trata de compromisos tangibles y concretos que ratifican la postura argentina frente al cambio climático.

“Como he dicho en varias ocasiones, para avanzar con la agenda de transformaciones necesarias debemos crear fuentes innovadoras de financiamiento y nuevas reglas e incentivos globales”, resumió.

Fernández también sostuvo que la sustentabilidad ambiental va de la mano de la sustentabilidad social. Asimismo, recordó que estamos impulsando un complejo productor y exportador de hidrógeno como nuevo vector energético y, dentro del marco legal, señaló que se ha enviado al Parlamento un proyecto de ley sobre electromovilidad”.",COP26 de Glasgow: presidente argentino insiste con cuestiones ya planteadas en Roma

Brasil estuvo representado en Glasgow por el ministro de Medio Ambiente, Joaquim Leite

El presidente de Brasil, Jair Bolsonaro, insistió en que su país era parte de la solución y no del problema del cambio climático. Las declaraciones de Bolsonaro se hicieron públicas después de la participación del ministro de Medio Ambiente, Joaquim Leite, en un evento paralelo en la Cumbre sobre Cambio Climático de la COP 26 de la ONU en Glasgow, al que el jefe de Estado brasileño decidió no asistir y quedarse en Italia.

Bajo Bolsonaro, la tala indiscriminada de la Amazonia creció para favorecer la agroindustria, convirtiendo a Brasil en uno de los 5 países que más han empeorado el calentamiento global.

Pero el presidente confía en su país, que posee el 60% de la selva amazónica, según un mensaje grabado transmitido por la televisión pública.

Brasil es parte de la solución para superar este desafío global. Los resultados alcanzados hasta 2020 muestran que podemos ser más ambiciosos, dijo Bolsonaro en un mensaje grabado la semana pasada.

El presidente explicó que el plan nacional de crecimiento verde de su gobierno fomenta la atracción de inversiones en economía renovable mediante la creación de puestos de trabajo en actividades sostenibles.

El anuncio del ministro Leite en Glasgow, sin embargo, carecía de detalles sobre la ejecución de dicho plan.

“Hoy presentamos una nueva meta climática, más ambiciosa, pasar del 43% al 50% hasta el 2030 de reducción de gas, y de carbono neutral hasta el 2050, algo que se formalizará en la COP26”, dijo Leite en su discurso.

Brasil se encuentra bajo presión internacional como consecuencia de la legislación que busca aprobar Bolsonaro para permitir la ganadería, la agricultura y la minería en las reservas indígenas amazónicas, luego de que aumentó la deforestación por actividades ilegales desde que asumió el cargo en 2019.

Los ambientalistas criticaron el discurso de Leite, alegando que no había un programa real para implementar estas reducciones y que Brasil ha recalculado sus objetivos sin tener en cuenta el compromiso de la ex presidenta Dilma Rousseff en el Acuerdo de París de 2015.

Si Brasil quiere presentar un compromiso con el Acuerdo de País, la meta debe ser una reducción del 80%, dijo la entidad del Observatorio del Clima.

If the Senate decides to sack Piñera, Interior Ministry Rodrigo Delgado would take over the Presidency for the remainder of Piñera's term.

The parliamentarian debate lasted around 22 hours.

Chile's Lower House Tuesday passed a motion to impeach President Sebastián Piñera for his involvement in the Dominga mining company affair, which was included in the Pandora Papers report.

It will now be up to the Senate to decide on the fate of the President, who has not been suspended from duty despite the voting outcome at the House of Deputies.

The Dominga transaction was carried out in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands.

The lawmakers barely garnered 78 votes to pass the motion, while 67 other deputies voted against seeking Piñera's dismissal. There were also 3 abstentions.

Piñera's lawyer Jorge Gálvez had begged the “honourable deputies, to reject this unjust and inadmissible constitutional accusation, but to no avail.

In reaching this decision after a debate that lasted around 22 hours, the Lower House understood Piñera openly broke the Constitution and other laws, in addition to jeopardizing the honour of the nation.

Socialist Deputy Jaime Naranjo took 15 hours to read the accusation in full. He stressed that Piñera had failed the principle of probity and “seriously compromised the honour of the Nation.

Naranjo's summed up his speech by saying “I hope this house approves the constitutional accusation, but (...) Chile will judge those who are allowing this impunity in the country,” he emphasized.

For the initiative to move forward 77 votes were needed, while Piñera's dismissal by the Senate needs two-thirds of the Upper House.

Gálvez also insisted this decision was politically motivated due to the proximity of the Nov. 21 elections and urged lawmakers to reject the accusatory text, considering it inadmissible since it was a political-electoral manoeuvre.

If the Senate decides to sack Piñera, Interior Ministry Rodrigo Delgado would take over the Presidency for the remainder of Piñera's term.

The constitutional accusation was presented by a group of opposition parliamentarians after the Pandora Papers related to the sale of the Dominga mining project by the Piñera Morel family to their friend Carlos Délano became known.

The transaction was made in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands in 2010 after Piñera had taken office for his first term as President. In the contract revealed by the investigation, a clause had conditioned the third payment to the Domina area not being declared a sanctuary, something which is up to the Council of Ministers.



After a marathon session of 22 continuous hours since Monday morning, the opposition managed to keep Congress active until enough votes were garnered.

Socialist opposition deputy Jaime Naranjo, who acted as rapporteur for the House, took about 15 hours to outline the alleged presidential misdoings which in his view justified the impeachment.

After Naranjo's long speech, which ended around 1.30 am Tuesday, Piñera's lawyer Jorge Gálvez unsuccessfully tried to defend the conservative head of state, claiming an investigative committee was the most logical solution and not the straightforward impeachment.

The Senate will have to vote - most likely this Friday, November 12 – to decide if the head of State needs to be removed from office, for which 29 votes will be needed.

To add to a heated up atmosphere, Christian Democratic Deputy Jorge Sabag had symptoms of Covid after travelling from Chillán (400 kilometres south of Santiago) despite having a pending PCR test. His presence sparked controversy and the Valparaíso Health authorities arrived at the place after midnight.

Naranjo also highlighted the opposition's decision to allow him to read out the document on behalf of all the lawmakers who were in favour of impeaching the head of state.

“What we did today has only one explanation, the unity of the opposition and the generosity of the opposition to allow me to lead something that I had outlined that some did not understand, Naranjo explained.

Naranjo said he spoke, with fundamentals, seriously and responsibly because a Constitutional Indictment is a very serious thing and you were witnesses that I gave serious fundamentals as to why it had to be approved.

Naranjo stressed that the most important thing was that today this opposition has sent a message of hope, of faith to Chileans, that a much better country can be built, that we may have a president who is an example and not like the situation in which we see ourselves today: with a president who has not only acted outside of the administrative integrity that is required, but has also acted seriously in damaging the image of the nation.

We know that it is difficult to get votes in the Senate. It will be our job to convince the senators. We have faith and hope,” he added.",Chilean Deputies agree Piñera needs to go through impeachment before the Senate

President Fernández underlined the concept of “environmental debt”

Argentine President Alberto Fernández Tuesday appeared before the Glasgow Climate Change COP26 Summit with the same proposal he made days earlier in Rome during the G20 Summit.

Fernández insisted on a debt swap for climate action before the plenary session of the Summit of Leaders of the United Nations Conference and again pointed to the IMF to reach a environmental solidarity, which serves to extend the terms of the debts and the application of lower rates 

The Argentine head of state was particularly keen on linking debt payment mechanisms to environmental actions and Argentina's commitment to the green agenda.

Fernández proposed to create payment mechanisms for ecosystem services and ratified the Argentina's commitment to the Paris Agreement.

The President also said he favored applying International Monetary Fund (IMF) Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to a great pact of environmental solidarity and stressed the need to commit concrete contributions, within the framework of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, which are accompanied by means for its implementation.”

We must create payment mechanisms for ecosystem services, swap debt for climate action and install the concept of environmental debt, Fernández said.

We must strengthen environmental multilateralism and promote the capitalization of the Regional Development Banks, he added.

The President also pointed out Argentina was making the fight against climate change “a state policy.

Fernández also vowed to implement profound measures to eradicate illegal deforestation, classifying it as an environmental crime.

He also said would be sending Congress a new draft for the Law on Minimum Budgets for Environmental Protection of Native Forests in addition to pursuing parliamentary “treatment of the Federal Environmental Education Law.

According to Fernández, these are tangible, concrete commitments that ratify Argentina's stance against climate change.

As I have stated on several occasions, to advance with the agenda of necessary transformations we must create innovative sources of financing and new global rules and incentives, he summed up.

Fernández also maintained environmental sustainability goes hand in hand with social sustainability. He also recalled that we are promoting a complex producer and exporter of hydrogen as a new energy vector and, within the legal framework, pointed out that a bill on electro mobility” had been sent to Parliament.",Glasgow's COP26: Argentine President insists on issues already outlined in Rome

Morales is said to be seeking a way to the Pacific Ocean through Peruvian territory

A Committee within Peru's Congress Monday agreed to declare former Bolivian President Evo Morales a persona non grata for meddling with internal politics, it was announced.

The Foreign Relations Committee approved to “Declare Juan Evo Morales Ayma persona non grata in our country for his negative political activism in Peru and his evident interference and in the political, social and economic agenda of the government of Peru, clearly detrimental to the interests of the Peruvian people; urging the competent authorities to prohibit his entry into our country for these purposes.

The document maintains Morales visited Peru in July 2021 under the Peruvian Government's protection and services to offer ungrateful statements that warn of his agenda according to foreign interests.”

It also points out that “Morales has been announcing a meeting for December 20 and 21, 2021 in the city of Cusco, under the name of a regional platform called Runasur, without officially knowing the meaning of the sponsorship of national authorities, demonstrating a total lack of respect to the Peruvian people.”

The Renovación Popular (Popular Renovation ) Congressional bloc disapproves of Runasur because it would be part of a strategy of the Sao Paulo Forum to dismember Peru. Hence the motion to Morales a persona non grata, which was passed Monday.

According to PR, the Dec. 20 and 21 convention in Cusco is a part of Evo Morales' geopolitical strategy to dismember southern Peru, northern Chile and create ‘the great homeland’, which would, in turn, be the goal of the Sao Paulo Forum.

The Peruvian MPs said Runasur sought to replace the Peruvian Macrosur, which includes the Apurímac, Arequipa, Ayacucho, Cusco, Madre de Dios, Puno, Moquegua, and Tacna regions and in the medium term link them to Bolivia and the north of Chile to obtain its long-awaited access to the Pacific Ocean.”

Additionally, it is said that as part of the creation of the “great homeland”, the installation of constituent assemblies that legalize multinationality is being promoted. The objective would be to build an economic unit rich in mineral resources and fertile lands on the coastal coastline with access to international markets. Finally, the alleged link to drug trafficking of Bolivian coca growers who today seek to spread in Peru is rejected.

A previous motion to declare Morales Ayma persona non grata put forward Aug. 19 had been rejected.

Morales had convened regional leaders to the Cusco gathering while in Buenos Aires. As Runasur, we approved the Declaration of Buenos Aires in which we reject the interventionist actions of the United States in complicity with international organizations that seek to destabilize democracy of our region and ratify the defence of our sovereignty and natural resources, Morales had said through Twitter.

The Declaration of Buenos Aires” also states that The governments or revolutionary peoples that defend the sovereignty of their resources are subjected to economic sanctions, coups that break the democratic institutions and establish policies of racism and fascism to exterminate the peoples.

Runasur is the mechanism of plurinational integration between indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants, social, union, territorial organizations and social movements of the region that seeks to resolve the historical debt to the peoples, Morales had said in Buenos Aires.

Runasur is conceived to take over from the dismantled Unasur created in 2008 under the influence of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, and supported vy Brazil's Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Argentina's Néstor Kirchner, Ecuador's Rafael Correa, and also Morales.

The crisis in the organization began in 2017 when the twelve member states could not agree on a new secretary-general, a situation that was aggravated by the conflicting positions on the Venezuelan crisis. The situation became critical when in April 2018 Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru suspended their participation and financing.",Peru's Congressional Committee declares Evo persona non grata

Lo peor está por venir si no aprovechamos este momento, según el presidente de Estados Unidos.

El presidente de Estados Unidos, Joseph Biden, dijo este lunes en Glasgow que la cumbre climática COP26 debería marcar “el punto de partida de una década de ambición e innovación” para combatir el cambio climático, que él considera una “amenaza existencial”.

La cumbre es vista como un punto de puesta en acción del histórico acuerdo climático de París de 2015.

Esta es la década que determinará las próximas generaciones. Es la década decisiva en la que tenemos la oportunidad de demostrarnos que podemos mantener la meta de limitar el calentamiento a 1,5 grados, advirtió Biden.

También insistió en que el cambio climático no es algo hipotético, sino algo que ya afecta a las personas en forma de incendios incontrolados, inundaciones o sequías.

Ninguno de nosotros puede escapar de lo peor de lo que vendrá si no logramos aprovechar este momento, enfatizó. También anunció nuevas iniciativas climáticas, que incluyen miles de millones de dólares en legislación para ayudar a las comunidades más pobres en el extranjero a lidiar con las consecuencias de este flagelo global. En una época en la que esta pandemia ha dejado tan dolorosamente claro que ninguna nación puede aislarse de las amenazas sin fronteras, sabemos que ninguno de nosotros puede escapar de lo peor que está por venir, si no aprovechamos este momento, subrayó Biden.

Biden elogió asimismo un acuerdo de acero entre Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea anunciado el domingo como una oportunidad para frenar las importaciones de acero chino sucio forjado con carbón. Es otro paso hacia el uso potencial de los mercados occidentales como palanca para persuadir a China, el principal contaminador climático del mundo, de que alivie su entusiasmo por la energía del carbón.

En lugar de una solución rápida, Glasgow es el comienzo de esta carrera de la década, por así decirlo, dijo el domingo el enviado de Biden para el clima, John Kerry, quien también defendió el resultado de la reunión del G20 en Roma, donde los líderes acordaron una serie de medidas, incluida la formalización de un compromiso para cortar los subsidios internacionales para las centrales eléctricas de carbón de combustión sucia.

Pero los líderes del G-20 ofrecieron más promesas vagas que compromisos de acción firme, diciendo que buscarían la neutralidad de carbono para mediados de siglo o alrededor de esa fecha.

Desde la firma del Acuerdo de París en 2015 con el objetivo de reducir la huella de carbono, EE. UU. ha aumentado las emisiones de carbono, pero se han tomado medidas en la dirección opuesta, mientras que los principales contaminadores como China, Rusia y Arabia Saudita no tienen una intención inmediata de hacer lo mismo.

Biden dijo a los periodistas el domingo por la noche que personalmente encontraba el resultado de la cumbre de Roma decepcionante, porque no solo Rusia sino China básicamente no se presentaron en términos de compromisos para hacer frente a los cambios climáticos.

El gobierno de Biden publicó este lunes su estrategia para convertir el discurso en realidad y transformar el país en una nación de energía completamente limpia para 2050. El plan a largo plazo, presentado en cumplimiento del acuerdo de París, establece un Estados Unidos que cada vez más utiliza energía eólica y solar y otras energías limpias, estadounidenses viajando en vehículos eléctricos y en transporte público, tecnología de vanguardia y amplios espacios abiertos cuidadosamente preservados para absorber el dióxido de carbono del aire.

La administración de Biden ha logrado, durante más de 10 meses de diplomacia antes de la cumbre de Glasgow, ayudar a ganar nuevos e importantes compromisos climáticos de sus aliados. Eso incluye persuadir a muchos gobiernos extranjeros para que establezcan objetivos más ambiciosos para la reducción de emisiones, promover un compromiso global para reducir las emisiones de un potente daño climático, el metano, y la promesa de las principales economías de poner fin a la financiación de la energía del carbón en el extranjero.

Los líderes europeos no ocultan que están felices de ver a Biden en acción, luego de que su predecesor, Donald Trump, le diera la espalda al acuerdo de París y a los aliados en general. La presidenta de la Comisión Europea, Ursula von der Leyen, sonrió a Biden durante el anuncio sobre el acuerdo del acero el domingo y lo llamó querido Joe.",Biden: esta década determinará las próximas generaciones con respecto al cambio climático

La tragedia es que el cambio climático no es una película, dijo Johnson.

El primer ministro británico, Boris Johnson, insistió este lunes en las responsabilidades que enfrentan los líderes mundiales, durante su discurso de apertura en la Conferencia de las Partes de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático (COP26) en Glasgow.

La indignación mundial será incontenible si los líderes reunidos en Escocia para la gran cumbre de la ONU sobre el cambio climático simplemente hablan y no actúan, dijo Johnson.

Todas esas promesas no serán más que bla, bla, bla, agregó sin admitir que esas palabras eran citas de la activista climática Greta Thunberg.

Johnson había hablado en la conferencia de prensa de cierre de la cumbre del G20 el domingo en Roma, donde se centró en la necesidad de una acción urgente sobre la emergencia climática del mundo. El jefe de gobierno británico también pidió un esfuerzo adicional para llegar a acuerdos más ambiciosos para prevenir el calentamiento global. Hemos hecho un progreso razonable en el G20 ... pero no es suficiente, dijo.

Johnson también sostuvo el lunes que el mundo estaba aproximadamente en la misma posición que James Bond mientras intenta desactivar un aparato apocalíptico en sus películas. Pero la tragedia es que esto no es una película y el dispositivo del fin del mundo es real.

El reloj avanza al ritmo frenético de cientos de miles de millones de pistones y hornos y motores con los que estamos bombeando carbono al aire cada vez más rápido ... y acolchando la tierra en un manto invisible y sofocante de CO2, elevando la temperatura del planeta con una velocidad y brusquedad que es enteramente hecha por el hombre, prosiguió Johnson.

Cuanto más dejemos de actuar, peor se pondrá y mayor será el precio cuando nos veamos obligados a actuar por la catástrofe, explicó y advirtió que las generaciones futuras no los perdonarían si no actuaban, y que sería correcto que así obraran.

Inspirado por su predecesor Winston Churchill, Johnson dijo que: Si bien la Cop26 no sería el fin del cambio climático, puede y debe marcar el comienzo del fin.

Uruguay encaró una segunda transición energética basada en la sustitución de combustibles fósiles en el transporte, dijo Arbeleche a la COP26

La ministra de Economía de Uruguay, Azucena Arbeleche, dijo al Foro de Energía para el Mundo Más Allá del Carbono, un evento dentro de la COP26 de Glasgow, que su país era uno de los más destacados en términos de energía renovable.

Arbeleche hizo esas declaraciones el jueves antes del Foro que tiene como objetivo promover acciones para eliminar gradualmente la energía del carbón en todo el mundo.

En su discurso, la ministra explicó que en la última década Uruguay ha desplegado diferentes instrumentos para promover la inversión privada en energía eólica. Como resultado, el país genera hoy el 97% de la electricidad a través de fuentes renovables, de las cuales casi el 40% es energía hidroeléctrica, el 30% energía eólica, el 25% biomasa y el 2% energía solar.

Arbeleche también señaló que Uruguay está emprendiendo una segunda transición energética, basada en la sustitución de combustibles fósiles en el transporte, con la posterior adopción de vehículos eléctricos, para lo cual el Gobierno estaba otorgando incentivos económicos. También anunció que su país estaba trabajando en un primer proyecto piloto para el transporte pesado de mercancías impulsado por hidrógeno verde.

La ministra uruguaya encabeza actualmente desde el 1 de noviembre el Comité de Desarrollo del Banco Mundial y el Fondo Monetario Internacional.

La funcionaria señaló asimismo a los asistentes a Glasgow que la emergencia climática global exigía acciones inmediatas y soluciones a largo plazo. Necesitamos cambios transformadores, dijo. Agregó que los mercados emergentes y los países desarrollados necesitarán billones de dólares en inversiones adicionales anualmente durante décadas para desarrollar energía verde e infraestructura resistente al clima. Los anuncios y compromisos, si no van acompañados de acciones y rendición de cuentas, son meras palabras, señaló.

Por otra parte, Arbeleche insistió en que los países desarrollados deben esforzarse por cumplir su compromiso de desplegar los recursos prometidos y que los países en desarrollo deben demostrar que están preocupados por el cambio climático y tomar acciones creíbles.

La ministra también dijo que favorece los incentivos concretos para los países y que las políticas sostenibles deben ser recompensadas. Los países que cumplen con sus compromisos y muestran un buen desempeño ambiental deben pagar tasas de interés más bajas, liberando así recursos para metas más ambiciosas, enfatizó.

La funcionaria anunció asimismo que el gobierno uruguayo está desarrollando un bono soberano indexado de acuerdo a indicadores sostenibles y sugirió que los préstamos de instituciones multilaterales también deben agregar ítems ambientales a sus operaciones financieras en forma de índices, con diferentes costos de financiamiento dependiendo del aporte de los países a bienes públicos globales.",Arbeleche enumera logros de Uruguay ante la COP26

The tragedy is climate change is not a movie, Johnson said

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Monday insisted on the responsibilities world leaders are facing, during his opening speech at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26).

“The global outrage will be irrepressible if the leaders gathered in Scotland for the great UN summit on climate change just talk and don't act,” Johnson said. All those promises will be nothing more than blah, blah, blah, he added without ever admitting those words were like quotes from climate activist Greta Thunberg.

Johnson had spoken at the final press conference of the G20 summit Sunday in Rome, where he focused on the need for urgent action on the globe's climate emergency. The British head of government also called for an additional effort to reach more ambitious agreements to prevent global warming. We have made reasonable progress in the G20 ... but it is not enough, he said.

Johnson also said Monday that the world was in roughly the same position as James Bond as he tries to deactivate a doomsday advice in his films. But the tragedy is this is not a movie and the doomsday device is real.”

The clock is ticking to the furious rhythm of hundreds of billions of pistons and furnaces and engines with which we are pumping carbon into the air faster and faster... and quilting the earth in an invisible and suffocating blanket of CO2, raising the temperature of the planet with a speed and abruptness that is entirely man made, Johnson went on.

The longer we fail to act and the worse it gets and the higher the price when we are forced by catastrophe to act, he explained as he warned future generations would not forgive them if they did not act - and would be right to do so.

Inspired by his predecessor Winston Churchill, Johnson said that: While Cop26 would not be the end of climate change, it can and it must mark the beginning of the end.

The opening of the Russian market is valid for six months. Normally the Russian import tariff for up to 530,000 tons is 15%.

Russia announced to Brazil that it was reopening its market for a quota of up to 300,000 tons of meat, at zero tariffs, including 200,000 tons of beef and 100,000 tons of pork. Likewise, Russia lifted restrictions on beef exports from a Minerva processing plant and certified a second plant to begin shipments.

The information was transmitted directly to Brazil's Minister of Agriculture and Livestock, Tereza Cristina, who is meeting with officials in Moscow. The opening of the Russian market is valid for six months. Normally the Russian import tariff for up to 530,000 tons is 15%.

Minister Cristina met with the head of the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, (Rosselkhoznadzor), Sergey Dankvert and agreed that Russian vets will make an inspection visit to Brazil in the first quarter of 2022 to enable new slaughterhouses to export to Russia.

In a signal of goodwill, Russia removed restrictions, pending since 2017, on a beef exporting plant and certified a second abattoir, both belonging to the Minerva Group. The decisions were personally informed to Minister Cristina during her Moscow visit.

The authorized slaughterhouses are SIF 791, in Rolim de Moura, Rondonia, and 2911, located in Mirassol d’Oeste, Sao Paulo. Produce processed at these plants, such as meat, offal, and bovine fats may begin entering Russia this month.

The slaughterhouse in São Paulo had been suspended since May 2017, when Rosselkhoznadzor imposed restrictions on Brazilian beef and pork due to “numerous detections of the beta-adrenostimulant ractopamine” in Brazilian meat products.","Russia reopens market to Brazil for 200,000 tons of beef and 100,00 of pork, zero-tariff"

I want the Overseas Territories to know they can rely on the UK, ...so let’s strengthen our partnership for the years ahead, Foreign secretary Truss

At the conclusion of a two-day meeting at the Foreign Office, the Joint Ministerial Council, JMC, which brings together UK ministers and Overseas Territories leaders agreed on a joint communiqué which included the agenda of issues addressed. Previous to the JMC the Overseas Territories Association held a meeting of their Political Council.

Over the course of the meetings plenary representatives discussed a range of topics, including the wide-ranging effects of COVID-19, the protection of the OTs extraordinary natural environments, ongoing security and law enforcement collaboration, and economic resilience.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss who attended one of the meetings said, I am proud of the UK and the British family, and the real value the Overseas Territories bring to our family. As Foreign Secretary, I believe we have a positive proactive role to play in the world – promoting freedom, free enterprise, democracy and the rule of law. I want to ensure the Overseas Territories are an integral part of Global Britain and benefit from a confident UK, with an active presence across the globe.

I want the Overseas Territories to know they can rely on the UK, just as we have shown during the pandemic. So let’s strengthen our partnership for the years ahead”

The Joint Communiqué reads as follows,

1 The Minister for the Overseas Territories, Minister for Europe and Americas, elected leaders and representatives of the Overseas Territories met as the Joint Ministerial Council (JMC) on 16-17 November 2021. Ministerial colleagues from across the UK Government, including Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Department of Transport, the Home Office, HM Treasury, Department of Health and Social Care, and the Department of Education also joined.

2 We welcomed the newly elected Leaders of the Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, St Helena and the Turks and Caicos Islands. We acknowledge a new form of Ministerial Government in St Helena.

3 Ministers, Territory leaders and elected representatives were also pleased to welcome representatives from the International Maritime Organization, UK Health Service Agency, National Police Chiefs’ Council and West Midlands Police, and senior officials representing the UK Government.

4 Delegates gave particular thanks to The Duke of Cambridge, whose closing remarks highlighted the need to tackle climate change. The Duke also met a selection of inspiring young people and climate advocates, who are working to protect the environment and tackle environmental issues in their territories.

5 They also thanked the Foreign Secretary for her attendance and welcomed her and the Prime Minister’s messages of support, which reaffirmed that the Overseas Territories are an integral part of Global Britain, and benefit from a confident UK, with an active presence across the globe.

6 The JMC is the highest forum for political dialogue and consultation between UK and elected leaders and representatives of the Overseas Territories for the purposes of providing leadership and promoting cooperation in areas of mutual interest. It provides a forum for the exchange of views on political and constitutional issues between the governments of the Overseas Territories and the UK Government: to promote the security and good governance of the Territories and their sustainable economic and social development; and to agree priorities, develop plans and review implementation.

7 The principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, as enshrined in the UN Charter, applies to the peoples of the Overseas Territories. The UK and Overseas Territories reaffirmed the importance of promoting the right of self- determination for the peoples of the Territories, which is a collective responsibility of all parts of the UK Government. We will continue to explore ways in which the Overseas Territories can maintain international support in countering hostile sovereignty claims. For those Territories with permanent populations who wish it, the UK will continue to support requests for the removal of the Territory from the United Nations list of non-self-governing Territories.

8 The UK set out its commitments to the Overseas Territories in the paper Global Britain in a Competitive Age: the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy. In addition, there is a shared commitment by the UK and the Overseas Territories to work together as partners to address challenges, from climate change to investment in physical infrastructure. The UK government will in consultation with the territories improve co-ordination across Whitehall departments, through regular ministerial meetings and a standing cross Whitehall programme board, and ensure Territories are regularly consulted on all relevant policy issues.

Climate Change Environment and Oceans

1. The Overseas Territories are custodians of internationally important habitats, which span the globe from the Antarctic to the Caribbean, the South Atlantic to the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Together with the UK, we represent the world’s fifth largest marine estate, over 90% of the UK’s biodiversity, and are essential to the UK meeting its pledge by 2030 to protect 30% of the world’s oceans. Climate change has a profound impact upon our environments, economies and societies, and failure to act impacts our present population and generations to come. To overcome the climate crisis facing our communities we must increase global solidarity and align our actions. The UK warmly welcomed the ongoing interest from some Overseas Territories in being covered by the Paris Agreement, and confirmed that the UK stands ready to support these Overseas Territories. The Overseas Territories formally extended their appreciation to the UK Government for facilitating their presence at the COP26 summit. COP26 provided an opportunity to showcase the precious and vulnerable natural environments in the Overseas Territories, and to generate high level engagement on environmental protection. We agreed that a greater level of engagement will continue for all Overseas Territories at future Convention on Biological Diversity and Climate Change summits.

2. We welcomed the UK’s acknowledgement that the Overseas Territories are on the frontline of the effects of climate change. The UK committed to work closely with Overseas Territory Governments where technical expertise was requested and to prioritise climate change and environmental issues in future funding for the Territories. The Overseas Territories committed to continuing to formulate ambitious climate targets and policies.

International Maritime Organization III Code

1. We discussed the successful outcome of the III Code audit. The UK reiterated that the representation of the UK and Overseas Territories in the international maritime arena is undertaken as a single entity by the UK on behalf of all and compliance with conventions is a shared collective responsibility.

2. The UK and the Overseas Territories agreed on the need for OTs to continue to work on their maritime obligations and have the ability to pursue full cost recovery from third parties in the event of a maritime pollution event in their waters.

3. We recognise how compliance with the III Code and other international maritime conventions will help Overseas Territories better manage the impacts of climate change. This includes zero-emission power generation on ships and will establish firm foundations for reliable maritime trade (Blue Economies).

4. We agreed to explore how Overseas Territories can manage emissions from their vessels and those of visiting ships in line with developing Climate Action Plans or decarbonization targets. We also agreed to consider how new maritime technologies might assist the Overseas Territories in managing issues around energy and waste.

5. The UK reiterated its commitment to support the Overseas Territories to complete the remaining mock audits, address gaps and build capacity and sustainability for the maritime sector. The UK and the Overseas Territories agreed to hold an initial round table discussion on the potential for transferring existing and emerging maritime technologies to land-based applications.

Economic Resilience

1 The UK Government is committed to supporting the Overseas Territories in building successful and resilient economies. We recognise that external shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters, can lead to significant fiscal and economic challenges for the small and vulnerable economies of the Overseas Territories.

2 We discussed the importance of robust infrastructure, sound public financial management and effective fiscal planning in supporting recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The UK will continue to work with the Overseas Territories to explore opportunities for diversification of economies, building resilience and investment. The UK Government will consider the interests and needs of the Overseas Territories when designing programmes and policies to promote the sustainable economic development of the Territories.

3 The Overseas Territories will make full use of the Territories’ financial resources in the first instance. The UK will continue to consider further requests for financial support on a case-by-case basis. The UK remains committed to meeting the reasonable assistance needs of Territories where financial self-sufficiency is not possible, as the Overseas Territories are a first call on the aid budget.

4 The UK Government and the Overseas Territories will continue to cooperate on meeting evolving international regulatory and tax standards to support compliant financial services.

Law enforcement

1 The UK and Overseas Territories noted the shared responsibility for ensuring the protection of our citizens across the Territories through the work of multiple agencies. The Overseas Territories welcomed the ongoing work by the UK Government through the Conflict Security and Sustainability Fund (CSSF) Justice Program and Border Security Program to help continue building, strengthening and modernizing law enforcement capabilities to fight crime and keep our borders safe. We recognize the importance of taking a holistic approach to crime prevention and recognize the growing threat of cyber crime.

2 Both the UK and Overseas Territories recognized that the underlying causes of crime are often complex and reaffirmed the joint commitment to build upon cross/multi-agency working to enhance co-operation and increase capacity within the Territories. We committed to sharing best practice and lessons learned by upholding the modern partnership between the Territory Governments, Governors and UK Government on areas of security and law enforcement.

Health

1 The UK was delighted to support the Territories with the provision of COVID-19 vaccines, and congratulated the Territories on the dedication of their teams, and having some of the highest vaccination rates globally. Overseas Territories recorded their appreciation for the supply of all vaccines including boosters, which demonstrates the benefits of working in partnership for the wellbeing of the people of the Overseas Territories.

2 We also recognized that the impacts of COVID-19 were not yet over and we committed to continue to working together collaboratively to bolster the health services in the Territories through existing and new links with the UK. The Territories welcomed this, particularly the UK’s commitment to work with the Territories to access the limited supply of the UK’s therapeutics supply.

3 The UK Government and the Overseas Territories re-affirmed their commitment to addressing mental health, recognising that “there is no health without mental health”. The pandemic has brought common challenges to the mental wellbeing of our people, as well as common opportunities to consider how we can all look after our mental health and wellbeing. We recognise that poor mental health can affect anyone, but that those who have suffered trauma such as domestic violence are more likely to be affected.

4 During the pandemic young people are more likely to have experienced worsened mental health. Despite these challenges, there has been promising work carried out in the UK and in many Overseas Territories to improve mental wellbeing, and noted the opportunities to continue. The Mental Health webinars organized by the UK Overseas Territories Association (UKOTA) in December 2020 and June 2021 brought together over 100 people from across the Territories. It is our ambition to continue the dialogue utilising UKOTA, with the next focus being Mental Health in the work place. Overseas Territories and the UK committed to continue the work to strengthen mental health systems to improve the lives of people with mental health problems, including children and young people, those who suffer from traumatic experiences, and those in the criminal justice system. 5 5 The Overseas Territories expressed regret for the delay in announcing the outcome of the NHS Quota Review and for pricing, and strongly encourage the UK Government to continue making progress in this area. The UK thanked the Overseas Territories for their input into the evidence-gathering phase of the Review and expressed commitment to progressing the Review.

Inclusivity

1 The UK and the Overseas Territories acknowledged the importance of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in promoting and protecting children’s rights. In furtherance of this and our previous commitments to the highest standards of protection for children and a zero tolerance approach to abuse, the leaders of the Territories to which the Convention has been extended committed to:

a) continue to promote and protect children’s rights as set out in the UNCRC, and to fulfill their Convention obligations; and

b) in light of the UN’s previous concluding observations, conduct a review of the outstanding reservations to the Convention with a view to seeking their withdrawal.

2 The UK and Overseas Territories discussed the important role that governments can play in promoting inclusive societies, and recognised the benefits of greater inclusivity. We heard about the initiatives that several of the Territories have been taking forward in order to generate more inclusive societies, and recognised the importance of learning from each other’s successes and challenges in order to identify opportunities for improvement and to better promote more inclusive societies.

Finally, the UK Government and the Overseas Territories welcomed the opportunity to come together as a Joint Ministerial Council and the opportunity this afforded to have frank and open discussions on areas of mutual interest. The Overseas Territories welcomed the UK Government’s commitment to continue to champion the interests of the Territories. We reiterated our joint commitment to deepening our unique and modern partnership.

* Teslyn Barkman MLA and Nikki Wilks, Junior Ambassador, discuss a busy week in London, including commemorating Remembrance Day and the Joint Ministerial Council, which is the annual meeting between the UK Overseas Territories and the UK Government in London and is an opportunity to strengthen the partnership between the governments.

La demanda de Brasil representa una oportunidad para colocar el excedente de energía disponible, dijo Basualdo.

El Ministerio de Energía de Argentina dictaminó que las exportaciones de energía a Brasil financiarán el gasoducto Vaca Muerta y las obras de transporte eléctrico, se anunció.

De acuerdo con la nueva decisión administrativa, los ingresos por exportaciones podrán destinarse a obras como un nuevo gasoducto y el plan de líneas de alta tensión. Así, las exportaciones de energía eléctrica a Brasil servirán como fuente de financiamiento para las obras de infraestructura que Argentina necesita para aprovechar al máximo su potencial en la producción de gas y generación eléctrica.

El nuevo financiamiento también proveerá para la construcción del gasoducto a Vaca Muerta (con un valor aproximado de US $ 1.800 millones) y el Plan Federal para Obras de Transporte Eléctrico (que representa aproximadamente otros US $ 3.000 millones).

Según fuentes del mercado privado, esta medida permitirá al Ministerio de Energía disponer de al menos US $ 100 millones extra hasta fin de año, que se sumarán a los US $ 500 millones recaudados por el llamado impuesto al patrimonio.

Hasta el momento, los ingresos por exportaciones se han diluido en gastos corrientes, principalmente subsidios (la diferencia entre el costo pagado por los usuarios y el costo de producción de energía). El nuevo mecanismo permite el uso de esos fondos como gasto de capital. Los grandes proyectos de infraestructura se han detenido desde 2018 debido a la crisis económica.

Sin poder endeudarse a tasas razonables, Argentina no ha podido iniciar ni completar obras de infraestructura necesarias para poner en marcha el negocio de exportación de energía a Brasil, incluido el nuevo gasoducto y el reforzamiento de líneas eléctricas urbanas con nuevas líneas de alta tensión que atraviesen todo el país, sumando capacidad de transporte para reactivar las inversiones en generación térmica, eólica y solar.

La Resolución 1037 del Ministerio de Energía crea una Cuenta de Exportación dentro del Fondo de Estabilización del Mercado Eléctrico Mayorista (MEM) que permite [que] los beneficios de las exportaciones de energía eléctrica a Brasil sean cobrados en una cuenta separada, cuyo destino específico es la ejecución de infraestructura energética funciona, informó El Cronista.

Estos ingresos se acumularán en dicha cuenta a partir de las transacciones económicas de septiembre de 2021 en adelante. En los primeros nueve meses de 2021 se exportaron 2.876 gigavatios hora (GWh) a Brasil, superando el récord anual de 2.618 GWh registrado en 2020.

El precio promedio de exportación el año pasado fue de 205 dólares por megavatio-hora ($ / MWh); mientras que en septiembre de este año subió a US $ 287,10.

Solo en septiembre de 2021, Argentina exportó electricidad a Brasil por US $ 258 millones. Las proyecciones para todo el 2021 rondan los mil millones de dólares.

El subsecretario de Energía Eléctrica, Federico Basualdo, comentó: El alto requerimiento energético de Brasil -asociado a la extraordinaria sequía que enfrenta- representa una oportunidad para colocar el excedente disponible del sistema local, a través de la interconexión internacional, por el convertidor de Garabí.

La decisión de crear una cuenta específica tiene como objetivo garantizar la finalización de las obras de infraestructura que el sistema necesita para ampliarse, agregó.

Al quemar diésel -que se importa para satisfacer la demanda energética interna y externa- las máquinas termoeléctricas se deterioran más rápidamente que las que funcionan con gas natural, lo que las encarece en términos de mantenimiento.

En tanto, el gerente general de YPF, Pablo González, prometió que próximamente se anunciará la construcción del gasoducto Néstor Kirchner a Vaca Muerta. González se refirió a la etapa entre Tratayén y Salliqueló, que será financiada con el “impuesto al patrimonio”.

En unos días se anunciará un proyecto, que es la construcción de un gasoducto que va de Vaca Muerta a Salliqueló y de Salliqueló a San Jerónimo con posibilidad de exportar gas a Brasil, dijo González en una entrevista televisiva.

La construcción de un nuevo gasoducto que permita llevar más gas desde Vaca Muerta al resto del país es una necesidad que fue catalogada como la más urgente del país.

González destacó que tenemos la segunda reserva de gas no convencional del mundo y la cuarta de petróleo -en referencia al recurso-. Lo que nos falta es capacidad de transporte.

Mientras tanto, y también como fuente de ingresos, Argentina importará gas licuado y lo revenderá a una central térmica brasileña a un precio 10 veces superior al que se cobra a nivel nacional por uso doméstico.

La firma argentina IEASA cerró un contrato de exportación con la termoeléctrica brasileña Ambar Uruguaiana Energía por casi 57 millones de metros cúbicos a US $ 43,80 el millón de BTU, lo que significará un costo final de operación de US $ 92 millones, según el Ministerio de Energía.

La diferencia entre el costo de importación y el precio de venta a Brasil permanecerá con IEASA. Después de los impuestos a la exportación, los analistas creen que rondará los 7 millones de dólares.

Brasil depende en un 60% de la generación hidroeléctrica para obtener energía. Pero durante dos años ha atravesado una sequía, que se ha agravado por la histórica bajada del río Paraná, y el país se ha visto obligado a buscar otras fuentes, como la importación de gas licuado en Río de Janeiro o la electricidad de Argentina.

La planta Ambar Uruguaiana se encuentra en el estado de Rio Grande do Sul y fue comprada hace unos meses por el grupo J&F a la empresa argentina Saesa. Tiene un contrato de entrega o pago con el administrador del sistema eléctrico brasileño, por lo que incluso con este precio del gas será conveniente para ellos generar energía en lugar de pagar sin unirse al sistema de suministro.",Exportaciones de energía a Brasil financiarán obras de infraestructura en Argentina

Providing 37% of the world’s energy, coal is the single largest source of electricity generation globally

By Daniel Parsons and Martin Taylor (*) – The Glasgow Climate Pact urges countries to “accelerate efforts towards phasing down”, rather than “phasing out”, coal power that isn’t mitigated by carbon capture and storage.

This subtle change to the text surfaced at the end of COP26, the latest UN climate change conference, at the insistence of India and China. So are these two countries to blame for the summit’s disappointing outcome, as many are suggesting?

Largely formed from plants and animals buried in the Carboniferous period 359 to 299 million years ago, fossil fuels like coal and natural gas are found on every continent. But their global distribution is not even – India and China have significant coal resources, but comparatively little natural gas.

Providing 37% of the world’s energy, coal is the single largest source of electricity generation globally. It is projected to remain the leading energy source into the 2030s, particularly because its use in India in China is still growing.

The UK has reduced its carbon emissions by switching from coal power to natural gas. Coal generated 41% of the country’s electricity in 2012, while natural gas made up 25%. A decade later, coal is almost non-existent in the UK’s energy mix and natural gas is the largest source.

Over half of the 30% reduction in the UK’s carbon emissions during the past decade were due to this switch from coal to gas, with the rest driven by a rapid increase in renewable generation.

Why natural gas burns cleaner than coal is due to a quirk of chemistry. The amount of CO₂ produced when a given fuel is burned is largely a function of the elements it’s comprised of. Natural gas is mostly carbon and hydrogen. This combination has a very high energy content relative to other fuels, and so, it produces relatively less CO₂ emissions for each unit of energy-burning it generates.

Impurities such as sulphur, which are common in coal, increase how much CO₂ is generated for each unit of heat. This means even the highest quality coal produces double the CO₂ emissions of natural gas per unit of energy.

Energy demand is closely linked with productivity. As economies like China and India rapidly grow and develop, their energy demand is expected to rise in tandem. But their ability to follow the UK in switching from coal to natural gas as a primary source of electricity generation is limited because they have comparatively less natural gas. The UK produces over half its natural gas from the North Sea and has made a lot of progress in ditching coal.

Per person, emissions in both China and India are still substantially lower than in almost all developed countries. India’s per-person emissions are less than one-quarter of the global average, and roughly one-tenth of those of the US. Close to a quarter of all carbon emissions come from manufacturing products that are exported and consumed in other countries. Textiles and clothes exported from India and South Asia account for over 4% of global emissions.

Labelling India and China as the chief villains of COP26 is a convenient narrative.

The financial aid which rich countries promised yet failed to deliver as part of the Paris Agreement signed in 2015 was supposed to help developing countries dump coal for cleaner sources of energy. And while the world berated India and China for weakening the Glasgow Climate Pact’s coal resolution, few questioned the fossil fuel projects being floated in developed nations, like the UK’s Cambo oilfield and the Line 3 oil pipeline between Canada and the US.

Switching from coal to gas offers a quick and partial win for reducing CO₂ emissions, but doing it depends on geology and geography. A rapid switch to renewable energy sources is easier when energy demand isn’t growing as fast like it is in rapidly developing countries. These countries need financial assistance from richer countries to make that leap. Until that is delivered, developed countries have no right to lay the disappointment of COP26 at the feet of China and India.

Todo indica que las florecientes exportaciones de carne paraguaya continuarán creciendo

Paraguay ha exportado más de 283.214 toneladas de carne vacuna entre enero y octubre de 2021, en lo que se ha convertido en un récord histórico para el país, según el Servicio Nacional de Calidad y Sanidad Animal (Senacsa).

Un informe detallado de Senacsa publicado este martes también mostró que Paraguay despachó 283,214,243.57 kilos de carne por un valor de US $ 1,372,943,994.63 en los primeros diez meses de 2021.

El documento reveló además que se habían colocado en el exterior un total de 50.747.649,06 kilos de menudencias bovinas por un valor de 104.527.687,40 dólares, mientras que 117.344 cabezas de ganado han sido sacrificadas para producir 28.731.587 kilogramos de carne vacuna.

Los principales destinos fueron Chile (116.887.663,20 kilos), Rusia (68.996.592,64 kilos), Brasil (25.814 126,91 kilos), Taiwán (25.429338,92 kilos), Israel (15.339.517,86 kilos) y Uruguay (5.021.692,86 kilos).

Mientras Paraguay celebra estos logros, una delegación del Departamento de Agricultura de los Estados Unidos (USDA) se encuentra en el país desde el lunes auditando la industria cárnica local para determinar si la carne paraguaya puede ingresar al mercado estadounidense.

Mario Balmelli, presidente del Comité de Carnes de la Asociación Rural de Paraguay (ARP) dijo que han hecho todos los deberes y por eso hay confianza para obtener la aprobación de Estados Unidos, ya que entienden que su industria está en los mismos niveles que los países que exportan a ese país.

Estamos muy seguros de que pasaremos la prueba, añadió Balmelli. Estados Unidos tiene sus procesos y burocracias que hay que considerar, pero luego de la auditoría de noviembre estamos seguros de que vamos a exportar a ese mercado”, prosiguió.

Balmelli también explicó que el objetivo era que se le otorgara una cuota similar a la de Uruguay y Argentina (20 mil toneladas).

Señaló asimismo que el aumento en el precio del estado se debió a un aumento en el costo de los suministros. “Hay que considerar el aumento de suministros, costos y servicios; el precio del productor es un valor que se ajusta de acuerdo con el costo de producción”.",Paraguay: Exportaciones de carne alcanzan máximos históricos

I have not seen any Californian saying that California is on fire, Bolsonaro argued

Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro Friday said the Amazon desertification alert was “the same old nonsense” and blamed the opposition for those reports which were aimed at denting the country's image and scaring away investors.

Bolsonaro stresses that the news concerning allegedly irreversible destruction of the Amazon by increasing deforestation and fires were false. He also insisted it had been spread by opponents seeking political gain.

If deforestation had the proportions they are saying, the Amazon would already be a desert, said the head of state upon returning from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar.

There is illegal deforestation, but it is enough that other countries do not buy our wood, it is simple. There are also illegal burning, but not in that proportion they count. And we fight them. Some say 'they have to fight them more' ... Do you know the size of the Amazon, how many countries in Europe can fit in?

The president also downplayed alarming data on the alleged destruction of the world's largest rainforest just one day after official data released by the Brazilian government showed the Brazilian Amazon lost 13,235 square kilometres of vegetation cover between August 2020 and July 2021, the largest degraded area for twelve months in the last 15 years.

While we strive to bring a good image of Brazil abroad, terrible Brazilians come out to criticize the country, to tell lies about the Amazon, Bolsonaro lamented.

The increase in deforestation in the period 2020-2021 calls into question Brazil's promise to reverse this trend and eliminate illegal deforestation by 2028, as promised at Glasgow's UN conference on climate change, where a report argued that the Amazon is at a point of no return and may become a desert.

Bolsonaro claimed, it is the same old nonsense; it is news sponsored by Brazilians who work against the country, drive away investments and generate many economic difficulties.

Until now I have not seen any Californian saying that California is on fire or a Chinese criticizing his country for requiring quarantines against pollution. I have never seen anyone speaking ill of his country as Brazilians do, he added.

The sources of fire are always in the same place and are generally caused by indigenous people, settlers and fishermen who have subsistence crops and set fire to prepare the land for new crops, said Bolsonaro, who minimized the fires caused by large landowners.

However, INPE data deny the president's statements. According to the state agency, only last June 2,305 fires were registered in the Amazon, the highest number for the month since 2007.

According to INPE, the most critical year was 2020, when a record 222,000 fires were recorded in the region.",Bolsonaro says Amazon crisis “same old nonsense”

Pathways for non native species. Dana M Bergstrom

By Dana M Bergstrom and Shavawn Donoghue – We tend to think Antarctica is isolated and far away – biologically speaking, this is true. But the continent is busier than you probably imagine, with many national programs and tourist operators crisscrossing the globe to get there.

And each vessel, each cargo item, and each person could be harbouring non-native species, hitchhiking their way south. This threat to Antarctica’s fragile ecosystem is what our new evaluation, grapples with.

We mapped the last five years of planes and ships visiting the continent, illuminating for the first time the extent of travel across the hemispheres and the potential source locations for non-native species, as the map below shows. We found that, luckily, while some have breached Antarctica, they generally have yet to get a stranglehold, leaving the continent still relatively pristine.

But Antarctica is getting busier, with new research stations, rebuilding and more tourism activities planned. Our challenge is to keep it pristine under this growing human activity and climate change threat.

Life evolved in isolation

Biodiversity-wise, much of the planet is mixed up. The scientific term is homogenization, where species, such as weeds, pests and diseases, from one place are transported elsewhere and established. This means they begin to reproduce and influence the ecosystem, often to the detriment of the locals.

Most life in Antarctica is jammed onto tiny coastal ice-free fringes, and this is where most research stations, ships and people are.

This includes unique animals (think Adélie penguins, Weddell seals and snow petrels), mosses and lichens that harbour tiny invertebrates (such as mites, water-bears and springtails), and an array of microbes such as cyanobacteria. The adjacent coast and ocean team with life, too.

The more we learn about them, the more outstanding life at the end of the planetary spectrum becomes. Just this week, new scientific discoveries identified that some Antarctic bacteria live on air, and make their water using hydrogen as fuel.

When the Southern Ocean has formed some 30 million years ago, natural barriers were created with the rest of the world. This includes the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the strongest ocean current on the planet, and its associated strong westerly surface winds, icy air and ocean temperatures.

This means life in Antarctica evolved in isolation, with flora and fauna that commonly exist nowhere else and can cope with frigid conditions. But the simplicity of Antarctica’s food webs can often mean there are gaps in the ecosystem that other species from around the world can fill.

In May 2014, for example, routine biosecurity surveillance detected non-native springtails (tiny insect-like invertebrates) in a hydroponic facility at an Australian Antarctic station.

This station, an ice-free oasis, previously lacked these interlopers, and they had the potential to alter the local fragile ecosystem permanently. Thankfully, a rapid and effective response successfully eradicated them.

Pressures from climate change are exacerbating the challenges of human activity on Antarctica, as climate change is bringing milder conditions to these wildlife-rich areas, both on land and sea.

As glaciers melt, new areas are exposed, which allows non-Antarctic species greater opportunity to establish and possibly outcompete locals for resources, such as nutrients and precious, ice-free space.

So far, we’ve been lucky

Our past research focused on non-native propagules – things that propagate like microbes, viruses, seeds, spores, insects and pregnant rats – and how they entrain themselves into Antarctica.

They can be easily caught on people’s clothing and equipment, in fresh food, cargo and machinery. Research from the last decade found that visitors who hadn’t cleaned their clothing and equipment carried on average nine seeds each.

But few non-native species have been established in Antarctica, despite their best efforts.

To date, only 11 non-native invertebrate species – including springtails, mites, a midge and an earthworm – have been established across a range of locations in the warmer parts of Antarctica, including Signy Island and the Antarctic Peninsula. In the marine realm, some non-native species have been seen but it’s thought none have survived and been established.

Microbes are another matter. Each visitor to Antarctica carries millions of microbial passengers, and many of these microbes are left behind. Around most research stations, human gut microbes from sewage have mingled with native microbes, including exchanging antibiotic resistance genes.

Last year, for example, a rare harmful bacteria, pathogenic to both humans and birds, was detected in guano (poo) from both Adélie and gentoo penguin colonies at sites with high rates of human visitors. COVID-19 also made its way to Antarctica last December.

Both these cases risk so-called “reverse zoonosis”, where humans spread disease to local wildlife.

What do we do about it?

Three factors have helped maintain Antarctica’s near-pristine status: the physical isolation, cold conditions and cooperation between nations through the Antarctic Treaty. The Treaty is underpinned by the Environmental Protocol, which aims to prevent and respond to threats and pressures to the continent.

There is unanimous commitment from Antarctic Treaty nations towards preventing the establishment of non-native species. This includes adopting a science-based, non-native species, which provides guidance on how to prevent, monitor, and respond to introductions of non-native species.

But time is of the essence. We must better prepare for the inevitable arrival of more non-native species to prevent them from establishing, as we continue to break the barriers protecting Antarctica. One approach is to tailor the newly developed 3As approach to environmental management: Awareness of values, Anticipation of the pressures, Action to stem the pressures.

This means ramping up monitoring, taking note of predictions of what non-native species could sneak through biosecurity and establish under new conditions, and putting in place pre-determined response plans to act quickly when they do.

‘Cetacean Strandings from Space’ infographic created by Lead Author Penny Clarke.

An international team of scientists led by the British Antarctic Survey have published research on using new technology to study mass stranding of whales from space and how the technology could be used to help protect populations.

The study published in Frontiers in Marine Science found that studying high–resolution satellite imagery could help build long–term cetacean (i.e. whales, dolphins and porpoises) stranding monitoring programs in remote regions and stranding networks globally. The team behind the study includes scientists from British Antarctic Survey, CEAZA (Center for Advanced Research in Arid Zones), Oceanswell and the University of Massey.

Whale strandings are becoming a critical ocean health issue and an increase in capacity to monitor and understand strandings is urgently required. The World Health Organization recently announced their ‘One Health’ approach, which recognizes oceanic conditions that impact whales often affect the marine ecosystem, with potential ramifications for human health too. Leading marine mammal experts made whale stranding response one of three core goals of the World Marine Mammal Conference in 2019.

The researches discuss making satellites a viable long-term monitoring tool, particularly for places where stranding response capacity is very limited and where surveys are infrequent. For remote regions, satellites could form an ‘early response’ tool, alerting managers to a problem and allowing for appropriate response, which could increase the likelihood of attaining useful diagnostic samples to understand exactly what is causing these events.

Penny Clarke, Lead Author of the study and PhD Researcher at British Antarctic Survey, said: “This study reveals that we need to increase the monitoring of mass strandings across the globe to greater understand cetacean populations, the threats they face and to evaluate the impact of future change. This is particularly important in remote regions, absent of stranding monitoring networks, where satellites offer an opportunity to gather baseline data in these regions.”

Dr Jennifer Jackson, Whale Biologist at British Antarctic Survey said: “As whale populations recover from whaling and suffer growing impacts from humans and from climate change, we need new tools to monitor these impacts, particularly in remote areas. Satellites hold a lot of promise for helping monitor those strandings over huge areas, as well as to look at local sea conditions, to help identify the causes faster, and make the right recommendations for ocean protection and management.”

Dr Asha de Vos, Founder and Executive Director of Oceanswell in Sri Lanka said: “Strandings happen across all our coastlines, but not all of us are equipped to monitor or document these events. Satellites provide us with a unique opportunity to monitor even the most far flung places but the key thing is increasing access. If we want to truly understand and protect our planet, we need to ensure equitable access to tools that can help us solve our greatest challenges together.”

The team analyzed satellite imagery collected from the Golfo de Penas, Chile in 2019, an area of annually recurring mass stranding events and the location of the original largest known mass stranding of baleen whales in 2015. The results show the power of satellites to deduce the timings of events, which could be vital for long-term monitoring programs.

The international team hope to challenge the current disparity in stranding monitoring efforts through use of satellites. They also call for collaborative partnerships between satellite providers and stranding networks governments and NGOs, for equal access to satellite imagery, a recommendation endorsed by the International Whaling Commission Scientific Committee.

The research highlights the importance of collaborating across remote sensing specialisms to determine if satellites may help understand the environmental and human induced conditions before, during and after a mass stranding event. Other remotely sensed data could help to highlight changes in the ocean environment and to provide an early warning system to mitigate mass stranding events and develop more informed, knowledgeable and rapid response stranding networks.

Moving forward, the team plan to test the robustness of this technology by partnering with existing and efficient stranding networks in hotspot areas, such as New Zealand, to develop working protocols and automated detection procedures. Following this they will concentrate on remote priority locations such as: the Chilean Patagonia region; much of the West and Eastern coastlines of Africa; the Polar Regions; and coasts in politically turbulent regions such as the North West Indian Ocean.

Senator Tester argues Brazil took much longer to inform OIE about the cases than other countries that faced a similar problem

United States Senator for the cattle breeding state of Montana, Jon Tester has presented a bill to suspend beef imports from Brazil. The congressman alleges that the Brazilian authorities were slow to notify the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) about the two cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as “mad cow disease”, confirmed in September, and which led to an agreed ban con beef exports to China.

Senator Tester argues Brazil took much longer to inform the OIE (UN Animal health organization) about the cases than other countries that faced a similar problem. “On 3 September 2021, Brazil announced two cases of atypical BSE detected in June of the same year. Most countries report similar cases immediately. This year, the United Kingdom and Germany reported cases a few days after their occurrence,” he said in a statement to the upper House.

The senator alleges that the delay generated a “breach of confidence”. “This has been a routine occurrence. Brazil also waited months or even years to report similar cases in 2019, 2014, and 2012 ”, he added.

Following on this argument, Senator Tester calls in his bill for an embargo on imports until specialists can conduct a “systematic review of product safety”. It is worth remembering that after notification to OIE, last September, the agency concluded a few days later that the risk of contamination of the Brazilian herd was “insignificant” since they were atypical cases.

“While rare and unique cases of atypical BSE do not necessarily indicate systemic problems with the health of the Brazilian cattle herd, repeated delays in reporting suggest an excessively lax food safety regime and raise concerns about reporting additional dangerous diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, African swine fever, and avian flu,” Tester concluded.

Similar arguments criticizing Brazil's poor, when not deficient, overall food safety rules and conditions have been exposed by several European countries, France, Belgium, Ireland, to avoid ratifying the EU/Mercosur trade agreement which is still pending after over two decades of negotiations.

Likewise, Brazilian meatpackers shut out of the Chinese beef market are finding some relief at U.S. butcher counters. In effect exports of Brazilian beef to the U.S. soared 183% during the first 10 months of this year, according to Brazilian Customs Office figures. Such shipments have been rising for months and the trend intensified after China restricted imports of Brazilian beef in early September due to two “atypical” cases of mad-cow disease.

While the amount sent to the U.S. is so far a fraction of the gigantic volumes China normally orders, major Brazilian exporters are pointing to the US as the main alternative market. Consumption in Brazil is weak amid economic distress, while other major meat importers such as Japan and South Korea still aren’t letting in Brazilian beef.

Brazilian farmers are also complaining that cattle prices have plummeted since the agreed protocol ban of beef sales to China which have yet to resume.

“The US reopening allowed us to ship volumes that would go to China,” Edison Ticle, chief financial officer at meats group Minerva S.A. Similarly Marfrig Global Foods, the world's largest protein processor and which controls US-based National Beef, said sales to the United States are rising and there is more to come.

The US reopened to Brazilian beef in 2020 after a ban of more than two years. Senator Tester in 2018 was re-elected for a third six-year term and is a Democrat in Republican territory. He is a strong supporter of rural US small businesses.",Montana Senator presents bill to suspend Brazilian beef sales to the United States
